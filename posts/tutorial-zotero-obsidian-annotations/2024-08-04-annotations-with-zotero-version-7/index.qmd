## Two Crucial Academic Workflow Challenges

As an academic researcher, scholar, or student, you likely find yourself
in a similar academic workflow. You collect, read, and annotate
scholarly articles, research papers, and books as part of your daily
routine. You then elaborate on this material in personal notes either
during the annotation process or immediately afterward.

The next step in the academic workflow involves:

-   Refine and structure the rough text passages.
-   Incorporating feedback from peers or supervisors.
-   Formatting them according to the publication guidelines.

These tasks can be undertaken individually or as part of a collaborative
effort.

In this chain of timely delayed tasks, one always had to meet at least
two challenges:

1.  While reading and annotating, how do you know which passages would
    later be necessary for the final publication?
2.  Are the annotations and notes sufficient to remember the context
    even after a long time?

These insecurities were still more cumbersome when one did not always
have immediate access to the original material, such as when you lent a
book from a library or the danger that the webpage could always
disappear.

One counter strategy to meet these challenges is to be safe and collect
as much material as possible. This includes saving all relevant
resources, making detailed annotations, and systematically organizing
them. But even then, finding the exact position of the text passage I
was looking for took time and effort.

In response to these challenges, I will introduce a solution that
significantly improves the efficiency of your academic workflow,
particularly when you always have access to the PDF resource.

## Annotations in Zotero

I started using Zotero on December 30, 2007â€”yes, during the holidays! I
always use the holidays to learn new apps and try things out. My Zotero
database currently holds 5872 items created during more than 15 years of
research. Until last year, I mainly used Zotero to produce correct
formatted citations for publication. However, these changed when I
learned new note-taking possibilities emerged with [Zotero
6](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/) (March 2022). It took me over
a year to transform my workflow. [Old habits die
hard](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Old+Habits+Die+Hard).

###### Zotero 7 update

This article focuses on the integration between
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
However, I will summarize some aspects of
`r glossary("Zotero", "Zotero's")` annotation process relevant to the
export/import process to `r glossary("Obsidian")`.

During the planning & writing of this post [Zotero
7](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/), the most significant update
in Zotero's 18-year history was released. Almost finished with the
article on August 18, I had utterly to revise the article to include the
[new features of version 7](https://www.zotero.org/support/changelog).
Whenever it is sensible in explanations, I will either add the addition
"(V7)" in parenthesis to emphasize the new features of Zotero 7 or write
another note like this one for a more extended text passage.

### Book recommendation

::: grid
::: g-col-6
For those of you that are interested to learn more about the philosophy
and theory of annotation, I recommend the book-length treatment
"Annotation" by Remi Kalir & Antero Garcia [-@kalir2021].

There is also a
[website](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/annotation) were you
not only can you read the book for free, but you can also see how
annotations features are used for an [open peer review
process](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) of the book
[@kalir2020].

::: {#def-annot .callout-important style="color: red;"}
Here, I will understand under the term "annotation" every addition
anchored to the text and reinforces it. Annotations are a kind of
[paratext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext), produced outside the
text but constantly referring and tied to it.

### Eight types of annotations in Zotero {#sec-eight-types-annot}

Zotero 7 has eight different types of annotations: highlighted text,
underlined text (V7), "sticky" notes, adding text (V7), screenshots,
drawing, resp. Ink annotation (V7), comments and tags.

![Six of the (eight) Zotero annotation types are selected with the menu
in the horizontal bar of the middle pane visible whenever a PDF,
EPUB-eBook or snapshot website is
open](six-annotation-types-min.png){#fig-annotation-type-menu
fig-alt="The annotated screenshot shows six icons horizontally aligned with accompanying text linked by arrows. The symbols and their meanings are (from left to right): The letter 'A' inside a square = highlight text; the letter 'A' underlined = underlined text; a paper with an earmark at the left bottom = 'sticky' note; a big letter 'T' = add text; two squares where the inner one with a solid line and the outer one with a dashed line = select area for screenshot; a small drawing and a pencil = add drawing."
fig-align="center" width="50%" group="zotero-annotation"}

###### Annotations for PDF, EPUBs, and Webpage Snapshots

With Zotero version 7, the following explanations are not only valid for
PDFs but also for eBooks in `r glossary("EPUB")` format and for
snapshots of web pages!
:::

#### 1. Highlighting

::: grid
::: g-col-3
![Zotero has eight colors for highlight and underline
annotations](zotero-annotation-colors-min.png){#fig-annotation-colors
fig-alt="The screenshot shows a vertical listing of the eight different colors available in Zotero. Each line starts with a colored box followed by the name of the color."
fig-align="center" width="70%" group="zotero-annotation"}
:::

::: g-col-9
::: {#vcenter .column width="50%"}
To highlight text, click the symbol with the letter 'A' surrounded by a
box at the top toolbar. You have eight colors for highlights at your
disposal: yellow, red, green, blue, purple, magenta, orange, and gray.
You can set your preferred color as the default color, which is, in my
case, yellow.

#### 2. Underlining (V7)

::: {#nte-zotero-underlining .callout-note}
###### Underlining as a new annotation type

Version 7 of Zotero supports underlining text with the eight colors
mentioned in @fig-annotation-colors.

Zotero treats highlighting and underlining as being very similar to
highlights. Therefore, I refer to both annotation types whenever I talk
about highlighting.
:::

It is crucial to design a consistent system when to use each color. This
will allow you to organize your annotations in Obsidian.

Some people have developed a system of argumentation types to
distinguish the different highlighting colors. Below are two examples to
give you a flair for the idea.

| Color   | [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2) | My own system                       |
|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Yellow  | Relevant / important                                                                | Running text                        |
| Red     | Disagree                                                                            | Important: Concept, Definition,     |
| Orange  | Question / confusion                                                                | ToDo                                |
| Green   | Agree                                                                               | Resources: article/book/package/URL |
| Blue    | Relevant to current task                                                            | \(R\) Code; Example                 |
| Magenta | TODO / follow up                                                                    | Section                             |
| Purple  | Definitions / concepts                                                              | Chapter                             |
| Gray    | Interesting but not relevant                                                        | Figure / table title                |

: Two examples of color classifications for text highlights
{#tbl-color-classification}

Both examples stem from times before Zotero 7. Therefore, there is no
difference, and both annotation types will translate to the same
meaning. I will explain more about the purpose of an appropriate
classification system when we talk about Obsidian templates for the
import of the Zotero annotations.

#### 3. "Sticky" notes

To add a "sticky" note, click on the piece of paper symbol with the
earmark. Then, you can click on a place in the PDF to generate the note.
A "sticky" note symbol appears on the page, and on the left bar, a note
box open for writing comments. You can move the "sticky" note around
inside the page, but you can't move it to another page (therefore
"sticky").

The primary purpose of "sticky" notes is to add a text annotation that
relates to the text but not to a specific passage of the text. This can
be, for instance, a comment on the structure of the text, a comment
related to several paragraphs, a recurring argument, etc.

#### 4. Text (V7)

With version 7, you can also write text directly into the document as an
overlay. Zotero treats this as a comment, e.g., add tags or change the
note text. But this annotation type is eye-catching, and you can move it
around, but only on the same page.

#### 5. Snapshots

By clicking on the black box surrounded by a rectangular selection, you
can drag with the cursor to select the area of the screen to capture.
You can add comments and tags as in the other annotation types, but you
can also copy the picture or save it as a `r glossary("PNG")` file to
your disk.

#### 6. Drawings (V7)

Your pointing device (mouse, stylus, touchscreen) will be converted to a
drawing device by clicking the ink button (with the drawing symbol).
Selected the appropriate color, you can now create drawings overlaying
the document.

#### 7. Comments

You can add additional text to all types of annotations mentioned so
far. Zotero will treat this additional text as your comment.

::: {#wrn-ID .callout-warning style="color: darkorange;"}
##### Changing highlighted text via the note?

Strange enough, You can also edit the highlighted text stored as
annotation. Frankly, I do not know appropriate use cases because, with
these changes, you would temper the original quote.
:::

#### 8. Tags

Another way to annotate a document is to add tags to highlighted text,
"sticky" notes, screenshots, or comments.

You can select all annotations with the same tag inside the document
(e.g., whenever the document is open and visible in the middle pane).
Colors work as a tag, too. Hence, you can select all highlighted text in
the same color. You can also combine different tags. For instance, two
text tags with two colors will select all annotations that have one of
these text tags or one of the chosen colors.

Outside the document, the tag works as a standard document tag in the
tag pane at the bottom of the left column. Although the tags are
attached to specific annotations outside the PDF (e.g., in the tag
pane), they will select only the Zotero item with the document where the
tag was used and not the appropriate annotations. But if you use the
same tag for annotation in different documents, Zotero will open all
items where these tags were applied.

We will see that after the export to Obsidian, these annotated tags gain
power as the work across all Obsidian documents!

### Summary

The Zotero documentation is not yet up-to-date, so detailed information
is still lacking or incorrect. For instance, is [The Zotero PDF Reader
and Note Editor](https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader) talking only
about the PDF reader (version 6). The best page so far is the
announcement page [Zotero 7: Zotero,
redesigned](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/). However, many
YouTube tutorials will explain the details of Zotero version 7 in
several weeks.

In the meantime, the following annotated screenshot may be helpful. It
recapitulates graphically the above textual description.
