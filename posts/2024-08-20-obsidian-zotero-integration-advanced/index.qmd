## Objectives

After the creation of Zotero annotations, as explained in [Annotation
Tutorial 1](../2024-08-20-annotations-with-zotero-version-7) and the
installation of two plugins (see: [Annotation Tutorial
2](../2024-08-12-academic-workflow-obsidian-zotero)) you can import your
annotations into Obsidian. In the second part of the tutorial I
described the easy way by using the default mechanism of the Zotero
Integration `r glossary("plugin")`.

In this third part of the tutorial, I am going to explain the more
complex import procedure by using templates. We have said that the
configuration setting page for the "Zotero Integration" plugin consists
of four parts:

-   General Settings ([Tutorial Part
    2](../2024-08-12-academic-workflow-obsidian-zotero))
-   Citation Formats (skipped)
-   Import Formats and (required and explained in this post)
-   Import Image Settings (additional configuration, also explained
    here)

I will skip the part on "Citation Formats" here. This section uses the
integration with Zotero to produce different kinds of citation formats
inside Obsidian. Except for "Formatted Bibliography," these formats
produce code within Obsidian usable for further conversion. Export
procedures. We can skip this part of the settings here for our purposes.

## Zotero - Obsidian Integration with Templates

Although all annotations are imported into Obsidian without templates,
you will lose many `r glossary("metadata")` of your notes. Without a
template, you are missing two types of metadata:

-   Metadata about the Zotero bibliography item (author, title, year,
    publisher, location, abstract, item tags, etc.)
-   Metadata about the annotation (colors and tags of the annotations)

You also lose control of where to store the files for notes and images
(default: your attachment folder) and to store images as
`r glossary("JPG")` (default: `r glossary("PNG")`).

Creating a Zotero Integration template is a complicated process for two
reasons:

1.  You have to know how to apply the
    [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
    template syntax. Nunjucks is a JavaScript templating language,
    supported by all modern browsers.
2.  You must know the names of the variables you want to import. You can
    inspect the variable names with the "Data Explorer" command of the
    Obsidian-Zotero Integration plugin.

After choosing the "Data Explorer" command, Obsidian will open a new
horizontal section with two buttons on the top.

1.  **Prompt for Selection**: It displays a dialog window to choose your
    library and Zotero item you want to import. Please be patient —
    Obsidian may take seconds to open the dialog window.
2.  **Preview Import Format**: This is the default value of this menu
    (button). It will display all the variable's names and values for
    the Zotero item. However, you can also select one of your templates
    defined in the Zotero Integration plugin to see the result. The
    "Data Explorer" is an important tool for creating and improving
    Obsidian-Zotero Integration templates.

![Part of the Data Explorer for the Zotero Integration plugin. You can
open/close hierarchical values by clicking on the small triangle as is
shown in the middle of the screenshot with
"creators".](advanced-zotero-integration-data-explorer-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-data-explorer
fig-alt="The screenshot shows the top two buttons, 'Prompt for Selection' and Preview Import Format'. What follows is the internal structure of the Zotero annotation. It starts with 'Template Data {} 45 keys' with an opened triangle on the left. The next intended line starts gray with 'abstractNote' followed by the text of the abstract in yellow. Another intended line in gray says 'alltags' followed by yellow 'inequality' in double parenthesis. And so on. There are many different intended lines with closed triangles on the left, except for an open triangle saying 'creators' in gray followed by '[] 3 items' in white. The following three lines display the values for 'creators' with separate lines for 'creatorType author'; 'firstName Amary'; 'lastName Gethin'. There are many more lines with different values but similar structures."

## Template Examples

### Nunjucks Template Language

The best way to learn how to apply the Nunjucks template language is to
look through the somewhat meager [documentation of the
plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration/blob/main/docs/README.md)
and then experiment with examples developed by other people. I have
collected several examples for Obsidian-Zotero Integration templates.

-   [Doing History with Zotero and
    Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/history-notes/01+Notetaking+for+Historians):
    A very detailed article which not only contains a template example
    but also explains the whole integration process similar to this post
    here [@razglova2023].

    Zotero Integration template [@phelan2024a].
-   There is a collection of several templates in an important [Obsidian
    Forum
    post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310).
    There are many posts about general questions about how to apply the
    templates, I will list some posts that include template codes for
    you to experiment:
    -   [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2):
        An excellent and detailed template from the author of the Zotero
        Integration plugin. It also has code for strikethrough and
        underlining, which was impossible in the Zotero PDF reader at
        the time of the posting. This may originate from an external PDF
        reader. Another caveat: The color codes need to be corrected.
    -   [erazlogo](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/3):
        The author of the Doing History website mentioned above. Very
        detailed, it has on other pages of the website many other
        important practical tips for usage of the Zotero-Obsidian
        integration.
    -   [apflestrudelig](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/8):
        Several templates for special tasks, but truncated. To see the
        full template code, go to the [Gist article on
        GitHub](https://gist.github.com/lguenth/e8a5c4fa0b4a1ed6f8bd0b9ccfc31013)
        Click on the right top raw buttons to access the source file.
    -   [gustafferson](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/11):
        a comment with a reference to the template code in a \[GitHub
        gist article\]
        (https://gist.github.com/Gustafferson/698e92d1ac939d60a63aac35fe4c4c4e).
    -   [Zocahontas1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/12):
        Similar to mgmeyers but using for the color codes, the [Obsidian
        Highlights
        plugin](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin).
    -   [Zocahontas2](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/16):
        How do you add page numbers and a revised template?
    -   [espalia1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/65):
        Learned from the previous template approaches with minor tweaks.
        Added the meaning of the annotation colors to the output, that
        is mainly sorted by colors and inside the colors, then by
        chronology.
    -   [espalia1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/66):
        An updated version. Instead, for every quote its own callout, it
        just has one callout (admonition in Obsidian parlance) for every
        color. This improves reading tremendously.
    -   [Cat](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/67):
        A template with a very sophisticated text color system. The
        template uses notion color blocks snippets from [GitHub -
        deathau/obsidian-snippets](https://github.com/deathau/obsidian-snippets)
        to have different colored texts. (But this didn't work for me
        after a quick first trial.) Comments are in callouts, and the
        [Dataview
        plugin](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) is
        also used to generate a table of contents.
-   I just found out that there is [another forum
    thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/my-zotero-annotation-template-that-works/51662)
    about Zotero Integration templates. It is shorter and started
    January 2023, with the last post (so far) May 2024. I will add just
    one example here:
    -   [Albialy](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/my-zotero-annotation-template-that-works/51662):
        A simple template with the interesting feature that the colors
        of the Zotero, annotations are converted to underlined colors in
        Obsidian. (Maybe the conversion from background colors to
        underline-colors is a feature of Obsidian or of one of its
        plugin I am using.)

I have stopped with forum entry number 67 of 312 comments (February
2023) of the first Obsidian forum thread and just mentioned one of the
smaller (37 comments). So, there may be some other exciting templates in
more recent times.

### My template code

I am still refining my template to catch new possibilities of version 7
of Zotero. Therefore, the following template code is a work in progress
(WIP)

To understand how the colored highlights are interpreted, look up my
color classification in the [first part of the annotation
tutorial](../2024-08-04-annotations-with-zotero-version-7#tbl-color-classification).

### My CSS Snippet

For the correct formatting, you need to include a `r glossary("CSS")`
snippet into Obsidian. Take the code below and paste it into your .css
file following the procedure description of Obsidian [CSS
snippets](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/CSS+snippets).

### Result of my template

![Part of my Zotero Integration template for creating literature
notes.](advanced-zotero-integration-template-example-min.png){#fig-zotero-template-example
fig-alt="The screenshot shows a part of an Obsidian document in dark mode with a colored header. It starts with two yellow title headers, 'Highlights by Sequence…' and 'Sorted by Colors,' followed by three smaller green headers, 'Running text (Yellow) …', 'Concept, Definition Important (Red) …', and 'ToDo (Orange)'. What follows are quote admonitions (callouts) titled 'Highlight' in orange with a blue text paragraph and a red link to the page of the annotated document. The third of the four 'highlights' has the cursor in it and shows, therefore, the markdown code of this part of the Obsidian file."
fig-align="center" width="70%" group="zotero-integration"}

My template consists of four main parts:

-   **1. Metadata**: This includes the YAML header, the abstract, and
    other important information (title, cite key, bibliography, tags).
-   **2. Highlights by sequence**: All annotations are sorted by their
    position in the document.
-   **3. Highlights by color**: Annotations sorted by their meaning.
    This requires a correspondence between color and purpose/reference
    type of the annotation.
-   **4. Updates**: Changes after the first import are added at the end
    of the Obsidian file. To get a file without updates, change the
    folder position of the file, rename the original file, or delete it.

I am planning to improve this template in two ways:

1.  Only one admonition (callout) block for every color should exist.
2.  Integrating the text of my green (H3) headers into the title of the
    admonition (callout) block.

## Conclusion

With the annotation tutorial, I have demonstrated a modern technology
supported annotation strategy. Every one of the three parts of the
tutorial emphasizes one crucial aspect of this strategy:

1.  Creating annotation with Zotero in `r glossary("PDF", "PDFs")`,
    `r glossary("ePUB")`-eBooks or website snapshots.
2.  Installing two `r glossary("plugin", "plugins")` to build a bridge
    between Zotero and Obsidian to import notes created with Zotero from
    the annotated document.
3.  Scraping annotations directly from the original document and redact
    them in a way to optimize further work in the note-taking app
    Obsidian.
