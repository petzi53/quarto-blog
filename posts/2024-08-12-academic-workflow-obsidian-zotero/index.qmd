## Zotero Integration with Obsidian

### Academic Workflow

In the [first part of this annotation
tutorial](../2024-08-20-annotations-with-zotero-version-7), I have
described the different annotation types in Zotero version 7 and how to
use them. In this second part, I will explain a simple method for
importing Zotero annotations into Obsidian. These Obsidian notes will
link to the source of the annotation (quote) in Zotero.

These backlinks are essential because one cannot always remember the
original context of the citation. Especially if the creation of the
annotation happened long ago or if the original purpose of the quote for
a specific publication/research issue has changed, you need to check and
reassess the context of the quote. Only by looking up the annotation in
the source document can you prevent redundant and superfluous
information from remembering the context of the quote.

After reading and annotating, it is crucial to elaborate on the
highlighted content. The general strategy is to add, reformulate, and
include the citations in the paper that is in progress. Whatever these
changes are in the initial annotations, it is vital for an efficient
workflow to always have a reference to the original position of the
citation.

There are two strategies for the integration of your "research
assistant" (Zotero) with your note-taking app (Obsidian):

1.  Creating a note inside Zotero and importing it into Obsidian (this
    post).
2.  Extracting all annotation directly from the document
    programmatically (the third part of the annotation tutorial).

In both cases, you need to install two plugins: [Better
BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) in Zotero and [Zotero
Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) in
Obsidian.

## Notes in Zotero

### Child and Standalone Notes

Zotero knows two types of notes. (The type names are my inventions to
facilitate the explanation):

-   **Child Note or Items Note** belongs to the item where it was
    created. It lives inside the Zotero item.
-   **Standalone Notes** lives in the appropriate Zotero item collection
    but does not belong to any specific Zotero item. This note type is
    helpful for writing notes for multiple items.

Only the child note is an annotation because it fulfills the requirement
of the annotation: It is anchored to specific text -- even if it
consists itself of (a collection of) annotations.

Both types of notes can be created either as individual notes or as a
note that collects all highlights:

-   **Individual note**: This is a new, empty note item. You can write
    your text into the note directly or drag and drop annotations from
    the left column.
-   **Highlights note**: This note collects and copies all content
    created with the annotation types, as mentioned earlier. You are
    always free to add or change the note content.

The distinctions between child and standalone notes are not carved in
stone, as you can always drag a standalone note into an appropriate
Zotero item, and so it converts into a child note. You can also drag the
child note as an item itself in the Zotero middle pane, and so it
converts into a standalone note.

::: {.callout-important style="color: red;"}
You can create as many notes as you want. However, only child notes will
be imported into Obsidian using the Zotero Integration plugin.
:::

### How to create a child note

#### Add Note from Annotations {#sec-add-note-from-annotation}

1.  Select the Zotero item or the document (PDF, ePUB-eBook, website
    snapshot) inside the Zotero item.
2.  Open the context menu (right mouse click on my installation)
3.  Select "Add Note from Annotations"

#### Add (empty) Note

1.  Select the Zotero item (not the document).
2.  Open the context menu (right mouse click on my installation)
3.  Select "Add Note"

![How to add an empty child note: (1) Select the Zotero item (2) Open
context menu and (3) Select 'Add
Note'](zotero-integration-add-empty-child-note-min.png){#fig-empty-child-note
fig-alt="The screenshot shows different types of annotations with Zotero in a PDF. The page is divided horizontally into three parts. From left to right: a small sidebar (about 10% width) with the content of the annotations, the document with the annotations (about 70% width), and the context pane with metadata."
fig-align="center" width="70%" group="zotero-integration"}

To repeat: An "child note" is a note that is sorted under a Zotero item,
independently of where it was created initially.

We generate child notes as the easiest way to export notes into
Obsidian. This has the disadvantage that changes in the Zotero
annotations need another export to Obsidian. We will, therefore, cover
in the [third part of the
tutorial](../2024-08-20-obsidian-zotero-integration-advanced) an
alternative, a more complex way where the Obsidian plugin extracts the
annotations programmatically from the Zotero document.

## Installing Plugins

### Better BibTeX and Zotero Integration

For the import of annotations into Obsidian, we need two
`r glossary("plugin", "plugins")`. At the side of Zotero [Better
BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and in Obsidian the
[Zotero
Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).

-   **Better BibTex** makes it easier to manage bibliographic data,
    especially for people authoring documents using a text-based tool
    chains (e.g., based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) /
    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). This plugin has a rich
    functionality, but we are using it for the Obsidian-Zotero
    integration just for one feature: To create a file with citations
    and consistent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) cite keys.
-   **Zotero Integration** does the main work: It inserts and imports
    citations, bibliographies, notes, and PDF annotations from Zotero
    into Obsidian. For this functionality, it needs the installation of
    the Better BibTeX plugin as an enhancement for Zotero.

### Install "Better BibTeX"

> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your
> computer. Then, in Zotero, click "Tools → Add-ons" and drag the `.xpi`
> onto the Add-ons window. ([Plugins for
> Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins))

To find the latest version of the Better BibTeX `.xpi` file [click at
this link
here](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest).

For a more detailed installation procedure [see
here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).

### Install "Zotero Integration"

> In Obsidian, open Settings; on the left, under Options, open Community
> Plugins, on Community Plugins, select Browse and search for 'Zotero
> Integration' ([Help, How do I install the
> Plugin?](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration#help-how-do-i-install-the-plugin)).

For more details, especially troubleshooting the installation, see the
[README file of Better
BibTeX](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).

## Zotero Integration Settings

The last task is to adapt the settings of the Obsidian Zotero
Integration plugin.

1.  Open Preferences with the menu "Obsidian → Preferences…" or `CMD+,`
    (macOS) / `CTRL+,` (Windows).
2.  Scroll the left column down to "Zotero Integration" and select this
    plugin.

You will get a window with content similar to that in
@fig-zotero-integration-settings. The look may differ depending on the
Obsidian theme you are using. (I am using
[Cybertron](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron))

![Top part of the "Zotero Integration" plugin settings. For the import
method explained here, you need only to complete the "General
Settings".](zotero-integration-plugin-settings-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-settings
fig-alt="The screenshot shows the general settings for importing annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text."
fig-align="center" width="70%" group="zotero-integration"}

The configuration setting page for the "Zotero Integration" plugin is
complex. It consists of four parts:

-   General Settings
-   Citation Formats
-   Import Formats and
-   Import Image Settings

Although there are many preferences for the simple import method used in
In this post, we will only need to complete the general settings.

### General Settings

The first two settings provide the path to the main utility program for
extracting data from PDFs.
[pdfannots2json.js](https://github.com/mgmeyers/pdfannots2json/releases)
should work immediately after the installation of the "Zotero
Integration" plugin. Otherwise, you must download the tool and provide a
path to it.

In the third field, you specify the program you will use. The plugin
supports Zotero and [the Jurism project](https://juris-m.github.io/),
specializing in legal research, and is also based on the Zotero
reference manager. For advanced usage, you also have the option to
specify a custom port number. The default port where Zotero is listening
to `23119`. You don't need to change it in a standard configuration.
Only for a special Zotero configuration, e.g., when using Zotero on a
terminal server, you must provide another port number.

In the following field, you specify the path in Obsidian where the
Zotero annotations should be stored. I have used with "zotero" a
subdirectory of "annotation" because I have with
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) another app where I am importing
annotations into Obsidian.

The following two fields determine if Obsidian should open the imported
file and in the case, you have imported several at once, which of the
imported files.

The last option of the general settings is enabling the concatenation of
annotations. Although I have turned it on, I have yet to use this
functionality. Instead of concatenating files, I have used to separate
new data (updates) via template functions, which I will explain in the
[third part of the
tutorial](../2024-08-20-obsidian-zotero-integration-advanced).

## Import Annotation into Obsidian without Template

For this procedure, you need to create the annotation file in Zotero
manually, as I have already explained in @sec-add-note-from-annotation.

![Obsidian Command Palette displaying all available commands of the
Zotero Integration plugin. For some of the commands I have assigned
hotkeys.](zotero-integration-command-palette-min.png){#fig-obsidian-command-palette
fig-alt="The screenshots shows a search field with the text 'zotero inte'. Below are the found Obsidian command that contain the search string. From top to bottom: 'Zotero Integration: Bib Format'; 'Zotero Integration: Import notes' with shortcut CMD-CTRL-SHIFT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Pandoc Format' with shortcut CMD-ALT-CTRL-SHIFT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Data explorer'; 'Zotero Integration: Formatted Citation'; 'Zotero Integration: Create Literature Note' with shortcut ALT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Formatted Bibliography'; 'Zotero Integration: Insert notes into current document' with shortcut CMD-CTRL-Z."
fig-align="center" width="70%" group="zotero-integration"}

1.  Now change to Obsidian and choose either "Import notes" or "Insert
    notes into the current document" from the command palette. If you
    attach shortcuts to these procedures, you don't need to call the
    command using the Obsidian palette.
2.  You have to wait until a window with the Zotero database appears,
    where you can select the appropriate Zotero item. All note files
    inside the Zotero item will be exported. The first command ("Import
    notes") creates a new file; the second command inserts the
    annotations into the cursor position of the current Obsidian
    document.
3.  The results are annotations with two links: "Go to annotation" and
    the citation using the appropriate Zotero citation style. "Go to
    annotation" opens the PDF and jumps to the annotation's location in
    the original document. The citation link selects the appropriate
    bibliography item in the Zotero middle pane.

![An example of an annotation file. Every entry starts with a link to
the exact position of the quote and ends with a link to the bibliography
entry in the Zotero middle pane. Between these two links is the
annotated text passage surrounded by quotation
marks.](zotero-integration-example-without-template-min.png){#fig-annotation-example
fig-alt="Screenshot of an example of an annotation file with a black background. From top to bottom: A yellow header says 'Annotations'; Timestamp '(7/31/2024, 7:23:53 PM)'; Followed by three examples of annotated text.

Eexample: '(Gethin et al., 2021, p.12)'. Between these two links is the annotated text passage surrounded by quotation marks."

You can now elaborate on your notes using all the advanced features
Obsidian offers!

In the [third part of the annotation
tutorial](../2024-08-20-obsidian-zotero-integration-advanced), I will
explain how to use templates to programmatically extract annotations
from Zotero documents. This has several advantages, but it is more
complex to apply.

Are you satisfied with our result from this second part of the tutorial?
Then, you can skip the last part or read it later when the need for
better management of your different types of annotation arises.
