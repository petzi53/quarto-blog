RStudio.](quarto-get-started-min.png)](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-15-get-started)

## Initializing a Quarto Blog

There are several ways to start a new Quarto blog. I will use a menu
driven approach using
[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/ "RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R and Python").
For the following workflow you should have installed RStudio and have
some knowledge how to use it.

I will not explain everything related to creating a new Quarto blog;
instead, I will focus on my choices to initialize the blog.

I am using

-   R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14)
-   Quarto version 1.5.54

### New Project…

Inside RStudio, use the `New Project…` command and select
`New Directory` and then `Quarto Blog`.

fig-alt="RStudio new project wizard window with three options reading from the top: New Directory - Start a project in a brand new working directory; Existing Directory - Associate a project with an existing working directory; Version Control - Checkout a project from a version control repository."
fig-align="center"}

![RStudio project type window (Screenshot): Choose 'Quarto Blog' to

project](creating-quarto-blog-2-min.png){#fig-new-blog-project-window
fig-alt="The Project Type dialog window lists the choices for new project. The first seven options are visible: New Project, R Package, Shiny Application, Quarto Project, Quarto Website, Quarto Blog, Quarto Book. (From top to the bottom. Top left is a button 'Back' for returning to the previous dialog window. Bottom right is a 'Cancel' button to stop the initialization process."
fig-align="center"}

![RStudio Create Quarto Blog window (Screenshot): Fill the input fields
with the appropriate
data](creating-quarto-blog-3-min.png){#fig-create-blog-window
fig-alt="The 'Create quarto Blog' dialog window requires a file name for the directory of the repository, titled 'Directory name', a directory where the project will be created, titled 'create project as subdirectory of:' with a 'Browse' button to the right, a drop down menu selecting 'Knitr' as the current option, titled 'Engine', three lines of check boxes, titled 'Create a git repository' (checked), 'Use renv with this project' and 'Use visual markdown editor'. The last option is followed by a question sign to get more information about the choice of a visual markdown editor. Top left in the dialog window is a button 'Back' for returning to the previous dialog window. Bottom left is a check box 'Open in a new session', Bottom right are a 'Create Project' button followed by a 'Cancel' button for stopping the initialization process."
fig-align="center"}

-   I am using {**knitr**} as the engine.
-   The {**renv**} package is for creating *r*eproducible *env*ironments
    for R projects. I will not use it as I have no experience with this
    [complex package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/), and
    reproducibility is not an issue for my private blog (at least, I
    think so at the moment).
-   Selecting "Use visual markdown editor" is not important, as this
    option is for all `.qmd` files in RStudio always available. I think
    that this option only controls the default behavior whenever a new
    file for a post is created.

### Key Files

Clicking the "Create Project" button generates different key files and
opens the `_quarto.yml` file in the RStudio editor window.

![RStudio file listing window (Screenshot): Choose 'New Directory' to
start an new project from
scratch.](generated-files-at-start-min.png){#fig-rstudio-file-listing-window
fig-alt="At the top of the screenshot there are six tabs. From left to the right: 'Files', 'Plots', 'Packages', 'Help', 'Viewer', 'Presentation' with the 'Files' tab active. Under the tabs are several buttons. From left to the right: 'New Folder', 'New Blank File', 'Delete', 'Rename' and a drop down menu 'More'. Under these buttons is the full path to the active directory 'Home>Documents>Meine-Repos>quarto-pb-blog' where each subdirectory is an active link. Under this line starts the file listing with 'Name', 'Size' and 'Modified' columns. Each line of file names starts with an (unchecked) check box, and an appropriate icon. From top to bottom: _freeze, _quarto.yml, _site, .git, .gitignore, .quarto, .Rhistory, .Rproj.use, about.qmd, index.qmd, posts, profile.jpg, quarto-pb-blog.Rproj, style.css."
fig-align="center"}

If you can't see all five files starting with a dot (so-called
[dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#Unix_and_Unix-like_environments "Hidden folders an files in UNIX-Like systems start with a dot in their file names")) in your installation, go to the drop-down menu 'More' and check the last option 'Show Hidden
Files'.

Here’s a summary of the key files created within the starter blog
project:

| File                  | Description                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| `_quarto.yml`         | Quarto project file.       |
| `index.qmd`           | Blog home page.            |
| `about.qmd`           | Blog about page.           |
| `posts/`              | Directory containing posts |
| `posts/_metadata.yml` | Shared options for `posts` |
| `styles.css`          | Custom CSS for website     |

### Content of the Quarto Project File

Here is the content of `_quarto.yml`:

``` {.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "quarto-pb-blog"
  navbar:
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
```

### Content of the Blog Home Page

Here is the content of `index.qmd`:

``` {.yml filename="index.qmd"}
title: "quarto-pb-blog"
listing:
  contents: posts
  sort: "date desc"
  type: default
  categories: true
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
page-layout: full
title-block-banner: true
---
```

## Render Blog

![Source code of the blog home page 'index.qmd'-file within RStudio
window
(Screenshot)](click-render-button-first-time-min.png){#fig-source-code-blog-home-page
fig-alt="The screenshot shows a part of the RStudio source code window with two file tabs 'index.qmd' (active) and '_quarto.yml'. Below is a line of partly disabled buttons where the focus is on the 'Render' button that has below a tip tool saying 'Render the current document (SHIFT-CMD-K)'"
fig-align="center"}

You can control via
`Tools->Global Options…->R Markdown->Show output preview in…` whether
the rendered result appears in the browser window or in the viewer pane.
Generally, I use the "Window" option because it gives me a better view
of the real setting.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true"}
## During the rendering process, I got three warnings

As you can see in the above console output I got three warnings:

-   Unable to read listing item description from
    posts/post-with-code/index.html
-   Unable to read listing item description from
    posts/welcome/index.html
-   Unable to read listing preview image from posts/welcome/index.html
:::

These warnings are prompted by the fact that we need to render the
complete blog with SHIFT-CMD-B or by clicking "Render Website" after
choosing the "Build" button on the upper right RStudio pane. I will
explain render strategies in a later post.

## Summary

This is the end of the initialization process. In later blog posts I
will add more functionality and style the web page it to get a more
attractive appearance of the Quarto blog.
