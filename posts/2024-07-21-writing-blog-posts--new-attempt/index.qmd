  I planned to write at least ten articles within two months before I wanted to
  publish my new blog. I never reached this limit last year, guided wrongly by
  perfectionism.

## Motivations for writing blog posts

My conception, written in my first blog entry, needed to be revised. The
problem was a certain kind of perfectionism: I thought that my knowledge
about R issues was not deep enough to be interesting to other people.
After visiting the [useR!2024
conference](https://userconf2024.sched.com/), I changed my view in four
aspects:

-   R has a dynamic community where new people are constantly attracted.
    My meager knowledge could be helpful, especially for beginners, as I
    was struggling with the same starter issues not long ago. Sometimes,
    a person with intermediate knowledge can be more beneficial than an
    expert.
-   The R project is a very complex field. Nobody has the same level of
    expert knowledge in every area. Therefore, it is possible that some
    parts of my knowledge could be useful for other people, even if they
    are (in other areas or generally) much more advanced.
-   Putting my understanding into words so that other people can use
    this information for their project is an important exercise: It
    ensures that I have grasped the essentials and fosters my learning
    by writing down all the necessary details.
-   The most important reason to write blog posts about issues I have
    learned is the "Future me." After several months of working on other
    topics, I often notice that I have forgotten some details of
    procedures I have already learned.

To elaborate on the last point: In one case, I was looking for a
solution to a problem I experienced. After several web searches, I found
the solution on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). I was
shocked when I noticed that it was me who wrote the correct answer
several years ago!

## A new start

After the useR!2024, I was very motivated to resume the Quarto blog I
started in April 2023. I noticed that there are two versions: One
published via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and another one –
already pretty elaborated – locally.

### Looking for a glitch

The local version had a small but annoying flaw. It displayed three
colons `:::` at the beginning of the listing on the homepage and at the
end of every post. I knew that `:::` represents special [fenced
syntax](https://pandoc.org/chunkedhtml-demo/8.18-divs-and-spans.html)
for native `Div` blocks in [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/#).

Whatever I tried, I could not find the problem and solve it.

-   I looked into all articles to see if there was a redundant fenced
    syntax symbol.
-   I set for all posts `draft: true`.
-   I even cloned the remote repo only to get the same behavior.

### Starting from scratch

Another drawback was that I did not understand many code lines,
especially in `_quarto.yml` but also in `posts/_metadata.yml` and in the
main `index.qmd`.

Finally, I decided to start with a new blog. I created a new repo with a
different name, initiated a new RStudio project, and so on. As a
surplus, I documented every single step. I wrote extensive notes and
shot screenshots of every necessary action. After each tiny change, I
checked the results by rendering the blog.

### Lesson learned

As a result, I have extensive material to explain how to initialize a
Quarto blog, which I will publish in several posts in the next few days.
And I finally found the reason for the surplus fenced div!

::: {#tip-footer-text-quotation-marks .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## href-URLs without quotation marks in YAML file

The URLs of the right part of the footer text were incorrectly in
quotation marks. This would be a perfect passage in HTML, but it was
inappropriate as a Quarto directive.

I wrote:

``` {.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
    right:
      - text: Proudly powered by <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>
```

Instead of:

``` {.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
    right:
      - text: Proudly powered by <a href=https://quarto.org/>Quarto</a>
```
