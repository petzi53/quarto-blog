I plan to write an R Package. I will call it `hypo2md`, and it should
search and import annotations from
[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/ "is a open-source software for web annotations")
into R markdown files. I need this functionality to process my
highlights and comments generated during reading in my note-taking app
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/ "Obsidian is a note-taking app").¬†

But writing about my package plans is not the goal of this post. Here I
want to describe one of the learnings I had during my first experiments
with the¬†[Hypothes.is
API](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/).

Reading the two articles by Hadley Wickham about [httr2 R
package](R%20package) ([get
started](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/httr2.html)¬†and¬†[wrapping
APIs](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html)), I learned
the basics of how to interface with APIs. As Hypothes.is requires an API
user token, one particular problem I would need to overcome is¬†[secret
management](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html#secret-management).

Even after reading the detailed instructions multiple times, the code
described in "Wrapping APIs" didn't work for me. As I finally solved the
problem, I thought my errors could be interesting for other Newbies as
well.

## 5 steps to hide your secrets

I am not going to use executable R program code for the explanation. It
is difficult to show the functionality in a blog post and it may be even
more difficult to prevent misunderstanding as it happened with me, when
I followed the code.

::: callout-note
Note that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`,
`warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Tip with Title

This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="default"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse

This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by
the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or
`collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by
default.
