## Introduction

Shared YAML metadata can be defined at both the project and directory level:

- project level: filename `_quarto.yml`
- directory level: filename `_metadata.yml`

For more information, see [Project Basics â€“ Quarto Shared Metadata](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#shared-metadata)

## Project Level

On the project level, I will change only the provided URLs for my GitHub and Twitter accounts in this first step.

### Before My Change

``` {.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Life Long Learning Lab"
  navbar:
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://twitter.com
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css

```

### After My Change

```  {.yml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "Life Long Learning Lab"
  navbar:
    right:
      - about.qmd
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/petzi53/quarto-pb-blog
      - icon: twitter
        href: https://x.com/pbaumgartner
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
```

## Directory Level

We have seen in an [previous post](/posts/2024-07-24-default-blog-source-code/#fig-content-posts-folder) that there is a `_metadata.yml` file in the `posts` folder.

### Before My Change

``` {.yml filename="_metadata.yml"}
# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder

# freeze computational output
# (see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)
freeze: true

# Enable banner style title blocks
title-block-banner: true
```

### After My Change

``` {.yml filename="_metadata.yml"}
# options specified here will apply to all posts in this folder

# freeze computational output
# (see https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze)
freeze: true

# Enable banner style title blocks
title-block-banner: false

# Author name of all blog posts
author: 'Peter Baumgartner'

# Table of content settings
toc: true
toc-depth: 4

page-layout: article
```

The changes are self-explanatory, so short comments will suffice:

- `title-block-banner`: I have already removed the title block banner from the home page listings and will disable it for blog posts as well. (I will revise this decision after I have written several posts. Maybe the title block banner is very useful for displaying a short description of the article.)
- `author`: All articles in my blog will be written by me.
- `toc` and `toc-depth`: I want a table of contents on the right side of the blog post, with a maximum of four levels. (I will revise this decision after I have written some longer articles. Maybe the TOC levels go too deep.)
- `page-layout`: I have [already explained](/posts/2024-07-24-default-blog-source-code/#page-layout) the `page-layout: full` directive from the title home page `index.qmd`. Now we want an `article` layout, because it creates a content area with a page-based grid layout that provides margins, areas for sidebars, and a reading width-optimized body region.

## Git and GitHub

I will commit these third bulk of changes to Git and my demonstration repository `quarto-pb-blog` [on GitHub](https://github.com/petzi53/quarto-pb-blog).
