## My first blog entry with Quarto

This is my first entry in a new [blog powered by
Quarto](https://quarto.org/ "Welcome to Quarto – An open-source scientific and technical publishing system").
After continuously struggling with the complex machinery
[blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/ "first page of the online blogdown book") -
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/ "The world’s fastest framework for building websites") -
[Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/ "The site you need to grow as a creator — without the bloat"),
I feel like coming home from a trip abroad!

Following the Quarto guide [Creating a
Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html "Quarto websites include integrated support for blogging."),
it took me only 2 (!) minutes to render the provided blog template
locally. After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and
Netlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for
my blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web
presences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a
[GitHub
account](https://github.com/petzi53 "The complete developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software"),
GitHub credential, and a
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ "Bring it all together The fastest way to combine your favorite tools and APIs to build the fastest sites, stores, and apps for the web")
account.)

I never was happy with the rapid development of Hugo that brought with
it many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem
happened with the Academic theme by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/).
The end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten
some of the many details after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time
learning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive
subjects.

It was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced \`blogdown::checksite()\` and
the possibility of freezing to a specific Hugo version. But the work in
this environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it's
self-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for
over two years now states as a note from the authors: "Some of the
information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of
changes to Hugo and the blogdown package."

## Future plans

I am sure there will also be some intricacies I must learn and overcome,
but this will conform with all my other R knowledge. At the moment, my
feeling is enthusiastic: It is easy and intuitive to write on this
platform. I hope to finally overcome technical barriers and concentrate
on thematic topics. Since English is not my mother tongue, it is already
difficult enough to express myself precisely about complex
content-related questions. I really don't need any additional technical
difficulty.

In contrast to my previous website projects, I am planning two different
strategies: 

-   I will not go into the details of the website design immediately but
    will work on these issues from time to time.

-   I will not announce the website until I am sure I will use it
    regularly and long-term. I think that about 10 articles -- written
    in two months -- should give me the trust that I will use it
    sustainably.
