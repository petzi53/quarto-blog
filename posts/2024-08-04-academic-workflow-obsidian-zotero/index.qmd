## Two Crucial Academic Workflow Challenges

As an academic researcher, scholar, or student, you likely find yourself
in a similar academic workflow. You collect, read, and annotate
scholarly articles, research papers, and books as part of your daily
routine. You then elaborate on this material in personal notes either
during the annotation process or immediately afterward.

The next step in the academic workflow involves:

-   Refining and structuring the rough text passages.
-   Incorporating feedback from peers or supervisors.
-   Formatting them according to the publication guidelines.

These tasks can be undertaken individually or as part of a collaborative
effort.

In this chain of timely delayed tasks, one always had to meet at least
two challenges:

1.  While reading and annotating, how do you know which passages would
    later be necessary for the final publication?
2.  Are the annotations and notes sufficient to remember the context
    even after a long time?

These insecurities were still more cumbersome when one did not always
have immediate access to the original material, such as when you lent a
book from a library or the danger that the webpage could always
disappear.

One counter strategy to meet these challenges is to be safe and collect
as much material as possible. This includes saving all relevant
resources, making detailed annotations, and systematically organizing
them. But even then, finding the exact position of the text passage I
was looking for took time and effort.

In response to these challenges, I will introduce a solution that
significantly improves the efficiency of your academic workflow,
particularly when you always have access to the PDF resource.

## Annotations in Zotero

I started using Zotero on December 30, 2007â€”yes, during the holidays! I
always use the holidays to learn new apps and try things out. My Zotero
database currently holds 5872 items created during more than 15 years of
research. Until last year, I mainly used Zotero to produce correct
formatted citations for publication. However, these changed when I
learned new note-taking possibilities emerged with [Zotero
6](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/) (March 2022). It took me over
a year to transform my workflow. [Old habits die
hard](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Old+Habits+Die+Hard).

This article focuses on the integration between Zotero and Obsidian.
However, I will summarize some aspects of Zotero's annotation process
relevant to the export/import process.

### Book recommendation

::: grid
::: g-col-6
For those of you that are interested to learn more about the philosophy
and theory of annotation, I recommend the book-length treatment
"Annotation" by Remi Kalir & Antero Garcia [-@kalir2021].

There is also a
[website](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/annotation) were you
not only can you read the book for free, but you can also see how
annotations features are used for an [open peer review
process](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) of the book
[@kalir2020].

::: {#def-annot .callout-important style="color: red;"}
Here, I will understand under the term "annotation" every addition
anchored to the text and reinforces it. Annotations are a kind of
[paratext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext), produced outside the
text but constantly referring and tied to it.

### Five types of annotations in Zotero {#sec-five-types-annot}

In Zotero exists five types of annotations: highlighted text, sticky
notes, screenshots, comments and tags.

#### 1. Highlighting text

::: grid
::: g-col-3
![Zotero has eight colors to
choose](zotero-colors-to-choose-min.png){#fig-14-04 fig-alt="alt-text"
fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: g-col-9
To highlight text, click the pencil symbol at the top toolbar. You have
8 colors for highlights at your disposal: yellow, red, green, blue,
purple, magenta, orange, and gray. You can set your preferred color as
the default color, which is, in my case, yellow.

The chosen color overlays the text passage. This is a problem when you
want to print out your annotations. The upcoming version 7 of Zotero --
which is already available as [Zotero 7
Beta](https://forums.zotero.org/discussion/105094/announcing-the-zotero-7-beta/p1)
-- will therefore support underlining.

It is crucial to design a consistent system when to use each color,
because this will allow you to organize your annotations in Obsidian.
:::
:::

Some people have developed a system of argumentation types to
distinguish the different highlighting colors. Below are two examples to
give you a flair for the idea.

| Color   | [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2) | My own system                                 |
|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| Yellow  | Relevant / important                                                                | Running text                                  |
| Red     | Disagree                                                                            | Concepts, Definition, Important               |
| Orange  | Question / confusion                                                                | Resources (articles / books / package / URLs) |
| Green   | Agree                                                                               | Code                                          |
| Blue    | Relevant to current task                                                            | Section                                       |
| Magenta | TODO / follow up                                                                    | Chapter                                       |
| Purple  | Definitions / concepts                                                              | ToDo                                          |
| Gray    | Interesting but not relevant                                                        | Figure / table title                          |

: Two examples of color classifications for text highlights
{#tbl-color-classification}

I will explain more about the purpose of an appropriate classification
system when we talk about Obsidian templates for the import of the
Zotero annotations.

#### 2. "Sticky" notes

To add a "sticky" note, click on the piece of paper symbol with the
earmark in the top toolbar. Then, you can click on a place in the PDF to
generate the note. A "sticky" note symbol appears on the page, and on
the left bar, a note box open for writing comments. You can move the
"sticky" note around the page, but you can't move it to another page
(therefore "sticky").

The primary purpose of "sticky" notes is to add a text annotation that
relates to the text but not to a specific passage of the text. This can
be, for instance, a comment on the structure of the text, a comment
related to several paragraphs, or a recurring argument.

#### 3. Snapshots

By clicking on the black box surrounded by a rectangular selection, you
can drag with the cursor to select the area of the screen to capture.
You can add comments and tags as in the other two annotation types, but
you can also copy the picture or save it as a `r glossary("PNG")` file
to your disk.

#### 4. Comments

You can add additional text to all three types of annotations as your
comments. Strange enough: You can also edit the highlighted text stored
as annotation. Frankly, I do not know appropriate use cases because,
with these changes, you would temper the original quote.

#### 5. Tags

Another way to annotate a document is to add tags to highlighted text,
"sticky" notes, screenshots, or comments.

Inside the document (e.g., whenever the PDF document is open and visible
in the middle pane), you can select all annotations with the same tag.
Colors work as a tag, too. Hence, you can select all highlighted text in
the same color. You can also combine different tags. For instance, two
text tags with two colors will select all annotations that have one of
these text tags or one of the chosen colors.

Outside the document, the tag works as a standard document tag in the
tag pane at the bottom of the left column. Although the tags are
attached to specific annotations outside the PDF (e.g., in the tag
pane), they will select only the Zotero item with the document where the
tag was used and not the appropriate annotations. But if you use the
same tag for annotation in different documents, Zotero will open all
items where these tags were applied.

We will see that after the export to Obsidian, these annotated tags gain
power as the work across all Obsidian documents!

## Child and Standalone Notes in Zotero

Zotero knows two types of notes. (The type names are my inventions to
facilitate the explanation):

-   **Child Note or Items Note** belongs to the item where it was
    created. It lives inside the Zotero item.
-   **Standalone Notes** lives in the appropriate Zotero item collection
    but does not belong to any specific Zotero item. This note type is
    helpful for writing notes for multiple items.

Only the child note is an annotation because it fulfills the requirement
of the annotation @def-annot: It is anchored to specific text -- even if
it consists itself of (a collection of) annotations.

Both types of notes can be created either as individual notes or as a
note that collects all highlights:

-   **Individual note**: This is a new, empty note item. You can write
    your text into the note directly, or you can also drag and drop
    annotations from the left column.
-   **Highlights note**: This note collects and copies all content
    created with the annotation types, as mentioned earlier.

## How to create a child note in Zotero

But the distinction between individual and highlight notes is not carved
in stone, as you can always add text or other types of annotations into
notes or drag the complete note as an item itself in the Zotero middle
pane.

To get into the start position for the following graphics, you have to
select a PDF attached to a Zotero item element by double-clicking on the
item or the PDF inside the item.

![How to add item notes](zotero-add-note-skitch-min.png){#fig-14-04
fig-alt="alt-text" fig-align="center" width="95%"}
:::

::: g-col-4
1.  Click on the notepad symbol on the right pane to open the note tab.
2.  Click on the upper +-sign button to open the drop-down menu and
    choose "Add Item Note" to create an empty note or "Add Item Note
    from Annotations" to create a note with all the PDF annotations.
:::

::: g-col-1
:::
:::

The action above results in the view of the right pane in
@fig-zotero-annotations. The text in parenthesis in "Added (external)
item note from annotation" refers to the note generated from the
annotations created and edited on the left pane. This is in contrast to
the (internal) annotations inside the PDF. Typically, there shouldn't be
any difference, but I mentioned that you can edit the highlighted text.
In that particular case, there is a difference between external and
internal annotations.

To repeat: An "item note" is a note that is sorted under a Zotero item,
independently of where it was created initially. The plus sign under the
"All Notes" header creates a standalone note sorted at the top of the
appropriate folder/collection. This standalone note can be empty or
generate external annotations like the item note.

We generate an item/child note as the easiest way to export notes into
Obsidian. This has the disadvantage that changes in the Zotero
annotations need another export to Obsidian. We will, therefore, cover
an alternative -- more complex way -- where the Obsidian plugin extracts
the annotations directly from the PDF.
