  The article explains how I finally succeeded in deleting different branches
  in Git. It turned out – contrary to my previous mental model – that there
  are not only two branches but three (local, remote origin, and local
  remote-tracking branch).

## If a pull request is not accepted...

As I am not very experienced with R and coding, my knowledge of using
Git and GitHub is limited. Usually, I use the `pr_*()` family of usethis
functions as pull request helpers. They work very well -- as long as the
workflow follows the standard (successful) workflow:

Initiate the pull request with `pr_init(<branch name>)` Submit the
changes in the new branch with `pr_push()`. Click the "Create pull
request"-button to make the PR. After the code is accepted and merged,
conclude the process with `pr_finish()`. This sequence does not fly if
the workflow deviates from the above model. The mentioned article
describes the scenario of a discussion between contributor and reviewer
that finally results in the acceptance of the PR. But what about a
rejection of the PR?

## ... deletion of the remote branch with GitHub is not enough

This situation happened to me after I proposed fixing a typo for a repo
that had been frozen because of a necessary general overhaul. I thought
to delete the submitted remote branch at the GitHub site would bring me
back to my initial position.

But back in RStudio, it turned out that the deleted branch was still
there.

fig-align="center"}

Ok, I understood that my remote action did not delete the local branch
too. But why was the remote branch still there? After all, I had it just
removed. (I double-checked the deletion, and the remote branch at the
remote GitHub site was, in fact, completely gone.

## There are three, not two branches

After some research, I found an answer at StackOverflow with over 25.000
views! It seems that I am not the only one surprised by the situation.

After reading this and other answers at SO, I learned that there are
three different branches:

For every one of these three branches, one needs different commands to
delete them. And here -- as far as I understood -- we have met the
limits of RStudio and/or {usethis.} For the following commands, you have
to change from the console to the terminal.

## Useful commands for deleting branches

#### Deleting a remote branch

``` zsh
git push origin -d <branch>
```

#### Deleting a local branch

``` zsh
git checkout master # change branch, you can't delete a branch you are working on
git branch -d <branch>
git branch -D <branch> # Force-delete un-merged branches
```

#### Deleting a local remote-tracking branch

``` zsh
# 'dr' stands for "delete remotes"
git branch -dr <remote>/<branch>
git branch -dr origin/dev # example

# Delete multiple obsolete remote-tracking branches
git fetch <remote> -p  # 'p' stands for "prune"
git fetch origin -p    # example
```

::: callout-note
Don't forget to refresh the RStudio listing to verify that you have
deleted the branches.
