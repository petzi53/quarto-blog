I am a retired professor of Education Technology. As head of
the [Department of Interactive Media and Educational
Technologies](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en/university/faculties/education-arts-architecture/departments/continuing-education-research-educational-technologies.html) at
the [University for Continuing Education Krems
(UWK)](https://www.donau-uni.ac.at/en) (Austria), I researched how to
apply technology in settings of Life Long Learning. 

For more detailed information see my different blogs:

-   [Gedankensplitter](https://peter.baumgartner.name): German, still
    active.
-   [Thought Splinters](https://notes.peter-baumgartner.net): English
    2017-2022, not active anymore. It contains my English \[blog posts\]
    during this time span.
-   [Educational Patterns](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/):
    English, 2017-2018, not active anymore. It contains a download area
    for all my [published articles until
    2017](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/publication/),
    [slides](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/#slides) and other
    material.

I had held positions as a professor at several universities in Austria
and Germany (Klagenfurt, Münster, Innsbruck, Hagen) before I accepted
the nomination to Krems. I published 25 books (10 monographs and 15
edited volumes) and [over 200
articles](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/publication/).

With my retirement, I became a Life Long Learner myself. I am interested
in studying workflows for Open Science research, focusing on note-taking
apps like
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/ "A note-taking app as extensible knowledge base"),
[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/ "Annotate anything online"),
etc., and the [R programming
language](https://www.r-project.org/ "Free software environment for statistical computing and graphics")
for statistical computing and data science.
