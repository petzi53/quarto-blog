You collect, read, and annotate\nscholarly articles, research papers, and books as part of your daily\nroutine. You then elaborate on this material in personal notes either\nduring the annotation process or immediately afterward.\n\nThe next step in the academic workflow involves:\n\n-   Refine and structure the rough text passages.\n-   Incorporating feedback from peers or supervisors.\n-   Formatting them according to the publication guidelines.\n\nThese tasks can be undertaken individually or as part of a collaborative\neffort.\n\nIn this chain of timely delayed tasks, one always had to meet at least\ntwo challenges:\n\n1.  While reading and annotating, how do you know which passages would\n    later be necessary for the final publication?\n2.  Are the annotations and notes sufficient to remember the context\n    even after a long time?\n\nThese insecurities were still more cumbersome when one did not always\nhave immediate access to the original material, such as when you lent a\nbook from a library or the danger that the webpage could always\ndisappear.\n\nOne counter strategy to meet these challenges is to be safe and collect\nas much material as possible. This includes saving all relevant\nresources, making detailed annotations, and systematically organizing\nthem. But even then, finding the exact position of the text passage I\nwas looking for took time and effort.\n\nIn response to these challenges, I will introduce a solution that\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of your academic workflow,\nparticularly when you always have access to the PDF resource.\n\n## Annotations in Zotero\n\nI started using Zotero on December 30, 2007—yes, during the holidays! I\nalways use the holidays to learn new apps and try things out. My Zotero\ndatabase currently holds 5872 items created during more than 15 years of\nresearch. Until last year, I mainly used Zotero to produce correct\nformatted citations for publication. However, these changed when I\nlearned new note-taking possibilities emerged with [Zotero\n6](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/) (March 2022). It took me over\na year to transform my workflow. [Old habits die\nhard](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Old+Habits+Die+Hard).\n\n::: {#nte-zotero7 .callout-note}\n###### Zotero 7 update\n\nThis article focuses on the integration between\n[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).\nHowever, I will summarize some aspects of\n<a class='glossary' title='Zotero is free and open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials, such as PDF and ePUB files.

(Wikipedia)'>Obsidian</a>.\n\nDuring the planning & writing of this post [Zotero\n7](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/), the most significant update\nin Zotero's 18-year history was released. Almost finished with the\narticle on August 18, I had utterly to revise the article to include the\n[new features of version 7](https://www.zotero.org/support/changelog).\nWhenever it is sensible in explanations, I will either add the addition\n\"(V7)\" in parenthesis to emphasize the new features of Zotero 7 or write\nanother note like this one for a more extended text passage.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Book recommendation\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-6\nFor those of you that are interested to learn more about the philosophy\nand theory of annotation, I recommend the book-length treatment\n\"Annotation\" by Remi Kalir & Antero Garcia [-@kalir2021].\n\nThere is also a\n[website](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/annotation) were you\nnot only can you read the book for free, but you can also see how\nannotations features are used for an [open peer review\nprocess](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) of the book\n[@kalir2020].\n\n::: {#def-annot .callout-important style=\"color: red;\"}\nHere, I will understand under the term \"annotation\" every addition\nanchored to the text and reinforces it. Annotations are a kind of\n[paratext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext), produced outside the\ntext but constantly referring and tied to it.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: g-col-6\n![Book cover of Annotation by Remi Kalir & Antero\nGarcia](cover-annotation-min.jpg){#fig-cover-annotation\nfig-alt=\"The book cover is in black with a big red star on the lower left half. At the top, it says 'Annotation' in red, and underneath, in smaller white letters, 'Remi Kalir And Antero Garcia'. There is a red bar on the bottom of the image and a white text saying 'The MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Eight types of annotations in Zotero {#sec-eight-types-annot}\n\nZotero 7 has eight different types of annotations: highlighted text,\nunderlined text (V7), \"sticky\" notes, adding text (V7), screenshots,\ndrawing, resp. Ink annotation (V7), comments and tags.\n\n![Six of the (eight) Zotero annotation types are selected with the menu\nin the horizontal bar of the middle pane visible whenever a PDF,\nEPUB-eBook or snapshot website is\nopen](six-annotation-types-min.png){#fig-annotation-type-menu\nfig-alt=\"The annotated screenshot shows six icons horizontally aligned with accompanying text linked by arrows. The symbols and their meanings are (from left to right): The letter 'A' inside a square = highlight text; the letter 'A' underlined = underlined text; a paper with an earmark at the left bottom = 'sticky' note; a big letter 'T' = add text; two squares where the inner one with a solid line and the outer one with a dashed line = select area for screenshot; a small drawing and a pencil = add drawing.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"50%\" group=\"zotero-annotation\"}\n\n::: {#nte-zotero7-epub-snapshots .callout-note}\n###### Annotations for PDF, EPUBs, and Webpage Snapshots\n\nWith Zotero version 7, the following explanations are not only valid for\nPDFs but also for eBooks in <a class='glossary' title='EPUB (auch ePUB, Akronym für electronic publication) ist ein offener Standard für E-Books, documents and other digital resources.'>EPUB</a> format and for\nsnapshots of web pages!\n:::\n\n#### 1. Highlighting\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-3\n![Zotero has eight colors for highlight and underline\nannotations](zotero-annotation-colors-min.png){#fig-annotation-colors\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows a vertical listing of the eight different colors available in Zotero. Each line starts with a colored box followed by the name of the color.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-annotation\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-9\n::: {#vcenter .column width=\"50%\"}\nTo highlight text, click the symbol with the letter 'A' surrounded by a\nbox at the top toolbar. You have eight colors for highlights at your\ndisposal: yellow, red, green, blue, purple, magenta, orange, and gray.\nYou can set your preferred color as the default color, which is, in my\ncase, yellow.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n#### 2. Underlining (V7)\n\n::: {#nte-zotero-underlining .callout-note}\n###### Underlining as a new annotation type\n\nVersion 7 of Zotero supports underlining text with the eight colors\nmentioned in @fig-annotation-colors.\n\nZotero treats highlighting and underlining as being very similar to\nhighlights. Therefore, I refer to both annotation types whenever I talk\nabout highlighting.\n:::\n\nIt is crucial to design a consistent system when to use each color. This\nwill allow you to organize your annotations in Obsidian.\n\nSome people have developed a system of argumentation types to\ndistinguish the different highlighting colors. Below are two examples to\ngive you a flair for the idea.\n\n| Color   | [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2) | My own system                       |\n|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|\n| Yellow  | Relevant / important                                                                | Running text                        |\n| Red     | Disagree                                                                            | Important: Concept, Definition,     |\n| Orange  | Question / confusion                                                                | ToDo                                |\n| Green   | Agree                                                                               | Resources: article/book/package/URL |\n| Blue    | Relevant to current task                                                            | \\(R\\) Code; Example                 |\n| Magenta | TODO / follow up                                                                    | Section                             |\n| Purple  | Definitions / concepts                                                              | Chapter                             |\n| Gray    | Interesting but not relevant                                                        | Figure / table title                |\n\n: Two examples of color classifications for text highlights\n{#tbl-color-classification}\n\nBoth examples stem from times before Zotero 7. Therefore, there is no\ndifference, and both annotation types will translate to the same\nmeaning. I will explain more about the purpose of an appropriate\nclassification system when we talk about Obsidian templates for the\nimport of the Zotero annotations.\n\n#### 3. \"Sticky\" notes\n\nTo add a \"sticky\" note, click on the piece of paper symbol with the\nearmark. Then, you can click on a place in the PDF to generate the note.\nA \"sticky\" note symbol appears on the page, and on the left bar, a note\nbox open for writing comments. You can move the \"sticky\" note around\ninside the page, but you can't move it to another page (therefore\n\"sticky\").\n\nThe primary purpose of \"sticky\" notes is to add a text annotation that\nrelates to the text but not to a specific passage of the text. This can\nbe, for instance, a comment on the structure of the text, a comment\nrelated to several paragraphs, a recurring argument, etc.\n\n#### 4. Text (V7)\n\nWith version 7, you can also write text directly into the document as an\noverlay. Zotero treats this as a comment, e.g., add tags or change the\nnote text. But this annotation type is eye-catching, and you can move it\naround, but only on the same page.\n\n#### 5. Snapshots\n\nBy clicking on the black box surrounded by a rectangular selection, you\ncan drag with the cursor to select the area of the screen to capture.\nYou can add comments and tags as in the other annotation types, but you\ncan also copy the picture or save it as a <a class='glossary' title='Portable Network Graphic (PNG) is a non-patented raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The format was not designed for professional-quality print graphics but for transferring images on the Internet (hence the name ‘portable’). (Wikipedia)'>PNG</a> file to\nyour disk.\n\n#### 6. Drawings (V7)\n\nYour pointing device (mouse, stylus, touchscreen) will be converted to a\ndrawing device by clicking the ink button (with the drawing symbol).\nSelected the appropriate color, you can now create drawings overlaying\nthe document.\n\n#### 7. Comments\n\nYou can add additional text to all types of annotations mentioned so\nfar. Zotero will treat this additional text as your comment.\n\n::: {#wrn-ID .callout-warning style=\"color: darkorange;\"}\n##### Changing highlighted text via the note?\n\nStrange enough, You can also edit the highlighted text stored as\nannotation. Frankly, I do not know appropriate use cases because, with\nthese changes, you would temper the original quote.\n:::\n\n#### 8. Tags\n\nAnother way to annotate a document is to add tags to highlighted text,\n\"sticky\" notes, screenshots, or comments.\n\nYou can select all annotations with the same tag inside the document\n(e.g., whenever the document is open and visible in the middle pane).\nColors work as a tag, too. Hence, you can select all highlighted text in\nthe same color. You can also combine different tags. For instance, two\ntext tags with two colors will select all annotations that have one of\nthese text tags or one of the chosen colors.\n\nOutside the document, the tag works as a standard document tag in the\ntag pane at the bottom of the left column. Although the tags are\nattached to specific annotations outside the PDF (e.g., in the tag\npane), they will select only the Zotero item with the document where the\ntag was used and not the appropriate annotations. But if you use the\nsame tag for annotation in different documents, Zotero will open all\nitems where these tags were applied.\n\nWe will see that after the export to Obsidian, these annotated tags gain\npower as the work across all Obsidian documents!\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Zotero documentation is not yet up-to-date, so detailed information\nis still lacking or incorrect. For instance, is [The Zotero PDF Reader\nand Note Editor](https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader) talking only\nabout the PDF reader (version 6). The best page so far is the\nannouncement page [Zotero 7: Zotero,\nredesigned](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/). However, many\nYouTube tutorials will explain the details of Zotero version 7 in\nseveral weeks.\n\nIn the meantime, the following annotated screenshot may be helpful. It\nrecapitulates graphically the above textual description.\n\n![Screenshot of Zotero Reader and Note Editor with explanations of the\ngraphical user interface (<a class='glossary' title='A graphical user interface (GUI) is an operating system interface that enables user interactions with an electronic device through icons, images, and other graphical elements G2.'>GUI</a>).
