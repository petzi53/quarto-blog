Here in this second part I will explain a simple method to\nimport Zotero annotations into Obsidian. These Obsidian notes will\ninclude a link to the source of the annotation (quote) in Zotero.\n\nThese backlinks are an eminent important feature because one cannot\nalways remember the original context of the citation. Especially if the\ncreation of the annotation happened long ago or if the original purpose\nof the quote for a specific publication / research issue has changed you\nneed to check and reassess the context of the quote. Only with looking\nup the annotation in the source document you can prevent redundant and\nsuperfluous information to remember the context of the quote.\n\nAfter reading and annotating it is important to elaborate on these\nhighlighted content. The general strategy is to add, reformulate and\ninclude the citations in your paper in progress. But whatever these\nchanges of the initially annotations it is important for an efficient\nworkflow that you always have a reference to the original position of\nthe citation.\n\nThere are two strategies for the integration of your \"research\nassistant\" (Zotero) with your note-taking app (Obsidian):\n\n1.  Creating a note inside Zotero and importing it into Obsidian (this\n    post).\n2.  Extracting all annotation directly from the document\n    programmatically (the third part of the annotation tutorial).\n\nIn both cases you need to install two plugins: [Better\nBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) in Zotero and [Zotero\nIntegration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) in\nObsidian.\n\n## Notes in Zotero\n\n### Child and Standalone Notes\n\nZotero knows two types of notes. (The type names are my inventions to\nfacilitate the explanation):\n\n-   **Child Note or Items Note** belongs to the item where it was\n    created. It lives inside the Zotero item.\n-   **Standalone Notes** lives in the appropriate Zotero item collection\n    but does not belong to any specific Zotero item. This note type is\n    helpful for writing notes for multiple items.\n\nOnly the child note is an annotation because it fulfills the requirement\nof the annotation: It is anchored to specific text -- even if it\nconsists itself of (a collection of) annotations.\n\nBoth types of notes can be created either as individual notes or as a\nnote that collects all highlights:\n\n-   **Individual note**: This is a new, empty note item. You can write\n    your text into the note directly, or you can also drag and drop\n    annotations from the left column.\n-   **Highlights note**: This note collects and copies all content\n    created with the annotation types, as mentioned earlier. You are\n    always free to add or change the note content.\n\nThe distinctions between child and standalone notes are not carved in\nstone as you can always drag a standalone note into an appropriate\nZotero item and so it convert into a child note. You can also drag the\nchild note as an item itself in the Zotero middle pane and so it convert\ninto a standalone note.\n\n::: {.callout-important style=\"color: red;\"}\nYou can create as many notes you want. But only child notes will be\nimported into Obsidian with the Zotero Integration plugin.\n:::\n\n### How to create a child note\n\n#### Add Note from Annotations {#sec-add-note-from-annotation}\n\n1.  Select the Zotero item or the document (PDF, ePUB-eBook, website\n    snapshot) inside the Zotero item .\n2.  Open context menu (right mouse click on my installation)\n3.  Select \"Add Note from Annotations\"\n\n#### Add (empty) Note\n\n1.  Select the Zotero item (not the document).\n2.  Open context menu (right mouse click on my installation)\n3.  Select \"Add Note\"\n\n![How to add an empty child note: (1) Select the Zotero item (2) Open\ncontext menu and (3) Select 'Add\nNote'](zotero-integration-add-empty-child-note-min.png){#fig-empty-child-note\nfig-alt=\"alt-text\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"\ngroup=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nTo repeat: An \"child note\" is a note that is sorted under a Zotero item,\nindependently of where it was created initially.\n\nWe generate child notes as the easiest way to export notes into\nObsidian. This has the disadvantage that changes in the Zotero\nannotations need another export to Obsidian. We will, therefore, cover\nin the third part of the tutorial as an alternative a more complex way\nwhere the Obsidian plugin extracts the annotations programmatically from\nthe Zotero document.\n\n## Installing Plugins\n\n### Better BibTeX and Zotero Integration\n\nFor the import of annotations into Obsidian, we need two\n<a class='glossary' title='A plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. (Wikipedia)'>plugins</a>. At the side of Zotero [Better\nBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and in Obsidian the\n[Zotero\nIntegration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).\n\n-   **Better BibTex** makes it easier to manage bibliographic data,\n    especially for people authoring documents using text-based tool\n    chains (e.g., based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) /\n    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). This plugin has a rich\n    functionality, but we are using it for the Obsidian-Zotero\n    integration just for one feature: To create a file with citations\n    and consistent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) cite keys.\n-   **Zotero Integration** does the main work: It inserts and imports\n    citations, bibliographies, notes, and PDF annotations from Zotero\n    into Obsidian. For this functionality, it needs the installation of\n    the Better BibTeX plugin as an enhancement for Zotero.\n\n### Install \"Better BibTeX\"\n\n> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your\n> computer. Then, in Zotero, click \"Tools → Add-ons\" and drag the `.xpi`\n> onto the Add-ons window. ([Plugins for\n> Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins))\n\nTo find the latest version of the Better BibTeX `.xpi` file [click at\nthis link\nhere](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest).\n\nFor a more detailed installation procedure [see\nhere](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).\n\n### Install \"Zotero Integration\"\n\n> In Obsidian, open Settings, on the left under Options open Community\n> Plugins, on Community Plugins select Browse and search for 'Zotero\n> Integration' ([Help, How do I install the\n> Plugin?](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration#help-how-do-i-install-the-plugin)).\n\nFor more details, especially troubleshooting the installation, see the\n[README file of Better\nBibTeX](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration?tab=readme-ov-file).\n\n## Zotero Integration Settings\n\nThe last task is to adapt the settings of the Obsidian Zotero\nIntegration plugin.\n\n1.  Open Preferences with the menu \"Obsidian → Preferences…\" or `CMD+,`\n    (macOS) / `CTRL+,` (Windows).\n2.  Scroll the left column down to \"Zotero Integration\" and select this\n    plugin.\n\nYou will get a window with a similar content as in\n@fig-zotero-integration-settings. The look may differ depending on the\nObsidian theme you are using. (I am using\n[Cybertron](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron))\n\n![Top part of the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin settings. For the import\nmethod explained here you need only to complete the \"General\nSettings\".](zotero-integration-plugin-settings-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-settings\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows the general settings for importing annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nThe configuration setting page for the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin is\ncomplex. It consists of four parts:\n\n-   General Settings\n-   Citation Formats and\n-   Import Formats\n-   Import Image Settings\n\nAlthough there are many preferences for the simple import method used in\nthis post we only will need to complete the general settings.\n\n### General Settings\n\nThe first two settings provide the path to the main utility program for\nextracting data from PDFs.\n[pdfannots2json.js](https://github.com/mgmeyers/pdfannots2json/releases)\nshould work immediately after the installation of the \"Zotero\nIntegration\" plugin. Otherwise you have to download the tool and provide\na path to it.\n\nIn the third field you specify the program you are going to use. The\nplugin supports beside Zotero also [the Jurism\nproject](https://juris-m.github.io/), specialized for legal research but\nalso based on the Zotero reference manager. For advanced usage you have\nalso the option to specify a custom port number. The default port where\nZotero is listening is `23119`. You need to change it only for a special\nZotero configuration, e.g., when you are using Zotero on a terminal\nserver.\n\nIn the next field you specify the path in Obsidian where the Zotero\nannotations should be stored. I have used with \"zotero\" a subdirectory\nof \"annotation\" because I have with\n[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) another app where I am importing\nannotations into Obsidian.\n\nThe next two fields determine if Obsidian should open the imported file\nand in the case you have imported several at once, which of the imported\nfiles.\n\nThe last option of the general settings is the possibility to enable\nconcatenation of annotation. Although I have it turned on I haven't used\nthis functionality so far. Instead to concatenate files I have used to\nseparate new data (updates) via a template functions, which I will\nexplain in the third part of the tutorial.\n\n## Import Annotation into Obsidian without Template\n\nFor this procedure you need to create the annotation file in Zotero\nmanuallyas I have already explained in @sec-add-note-from-annotation.\n\n![Obsidian [Command\nPalette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) displaying\nall available commands of the Zotero Integration plugin. For some of the\ncommands I have assigned\nhotkeys.](zotero-integration-command-palette-min.png){#fig-obsidian-command-palette\nfig-alt=\"alt-text\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"\ngroup=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n1.  Now change to Obsidian and choose either \"Import notes\" or \"Insert\n    notes into current document\" from the command palette. If you attach\n    shortcuts to these procedures you don't need to call the command via\n    the Obsidian palette.\n2.  You have to wait until a window with the Zotero database appears,\n    where you can select the appropriate Zotero item. All note files\n    inside the Zotero item will be exported. The first command (\"Import\n    notes\") creates a new file; the second command inserts the\n    annotations into the cursor position of the current Obsidian\n    document.\n3.  The result are annotations with two links: \"Go to annotation\" and\n    the citation using the appropriate Zotero citation style. \"Go to\n    annotation\" opens the PDF and jumps to the location of the\n    annotation in the original document. The citation link selects the\n    appropriate bibliography item in the Zotero middle pane.\n\n![An example of an annotation file. Every entry starts with a link to\nthe exact position of the quote and ends with a link to the bibliography\nentry in the Zotero middle pane. Between these two links is the\nannotated text passage surrounded by quotation\nmarks.](zotero-integration-example-without-template-min.png){#fig-annotation-example\nfig-alt=\"alt-text\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"\ngroup=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this post I have explained how to integrate your \"research assistant\"\ntool Zotero with the note-taking app Obsidian.\n\n::: my-procedure\n::: my-procedure-header\nImport Annotations from Zotero into Obsidian (without template)\n:::\n\n::: my-procedure-container\n1.  Highlight or use other annotation methods in Zotero as explained in\n    the [first part of this\n    tutorial](../2024-08-20-annotations-with-zotero-version-7).\n2.  Create a note with the annotations in Zotero.\n3.  Install the necessary plugins: [Better\n    BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) in Zotero and\n    [Zotero\n    Integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration)\n    in Obsidian.\n4.  Complete the 'General Settings\" part of the \"Zotero Integration\"\n    plugin in Obsidian.\n5.  Choose either \"Import notes\" or \"Include notes into current\n    document\" into Obsidian.\n6.  Wait for the Zotero dialog window and choose the Zotero item with\n    the annotations.\n7.  Inspect the imported file content and test the links.\n:::\n:::\n\nYou can now elaborate on your notes using all the advanced features\nObsidian offers!\n\nIn the third part of the annotation tutorial I will explain how to use\ntemplates for a programmatically extraction of annotations from Zotero\ndocuments. This has several advantages but it is more complex to apply.\nBut maybe you are already satisfied with the result we obtained with\nthis second part of the tutorial? The you can skip the last part or read\nit later when the need of a better management of your different types of\nannotation arise.\n\n###### Glossary\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> term </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> definition </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Plugin </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program.
