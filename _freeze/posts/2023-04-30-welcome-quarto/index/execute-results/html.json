After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and\nNetlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for\nmy blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web\npresences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a\n[GitHub\naccount](https://github.com/petzi53 \"The complete developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software\"),\nGitHub credential, and a\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/ \"Bring it all together The fastest way to combine your favorite tools and APIs to build the fastest sites, stores, and apps for the web\")\naccount.)\n\nI never was happy with the rapid development of Hugo that brought with\nit many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem\nhappened with the Academic theme by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/).\nThe end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten\nsome of the many details after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time\nlearning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive\nsubjects.\n\nIt was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced \\`blogdown::checksite()\\` and\nthe possibility of freezing to a specific Hugo version. But the work in\nthis environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it's\nself-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for\nover two years now states as a note from the authors: \"Some of the\ninformation and instructions in this book are now out of date because of\nchanges to Hugo and the blogdown package.\"\n\n[![Screenshot from the introductory note by the authors of blogdown:\nCreating Websites with R\nMarkdown](intro-note-blogdown-book-min.png){fig-alt=\"A note from the authors: Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the blogdown package. If you have suggestions for improving this book, please file an issue in our GitHub repository. Thanks for your patience while we work to update the book, and please stay tuned for the revised version! In the meantime, you can find an introduction to the changes and new features in the v1.0 release blog post and this \\\"Up & running with blogdown in 2021\\\" blog post.

At the moment, my\nfeeling is enthusiastic: It is easy and intuitive to write on this\nplatform. I hope to finally overcome technical barriers and concentrate\non thematic topics. Since English is not my mother tongue, it is already\ndifficult enough to express myself precisely about complex\ncontent-related questions. I really don't need any additional technical\ndifficulty.\n\nI am sure there will also be some intricacies I must learn and overcome,\nbut this will conform with all my other R knowledge.

I really don't need any additional technical\ndifficulty.\n\nIn contrast to my previous website projects, I am planning two different\nstrategies: \n\n-   I will not go into the details of the website design immediately but\n    will work on these issues from time to time.\n\n-   I will not announce the website until I am sure I will use it\n    regularly and long-term. I think that about 10 articles -- written\n    in two months -- should give me the trust that I will use it\n    sustainably.\n",
