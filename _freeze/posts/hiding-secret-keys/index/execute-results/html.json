I will call it `hypo2md`, and it should\nsearch and import annotations from\n[Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/ \"is a open-source software for web annotations\")\ninto R markdown files. I need this functionality to process my\nhighlights and comments generated during reading in my note-taking app\n[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/ \"Obsidian is a note-taking app\"). \n\nBut writing about my package plans is not the goal of this post. Here I\nwant to describe one of the learnings I had during my first experiments\nwith the [Hypothes.is\nAPI](https://h.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference/).\n\nReading the two articles by Hadley Wickham about [httr2 R\npackage](R%20package) ([get\nstarted](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/httr2.html) and [wrapping\nAPIs](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html)), I learned\nthe basics of how to interface with APIs. As Hypothes.is requires an API\nuser token, one particular problem I would need to overcome is [secret\nmanagement](https://httr2.r-lib.org/articles/wrapping-apis.html#secret-management).\n\nEven after reading the detailed instructions multiple times, the code\ndescribed in \"Wrapping APIs\" didn't work for me. As I finally solved the\nproblem, I thought my errors could be interesting for other Newbies as\nwell.\n\n## 5 steps to hide your secrets\n\nI am not going to use executable R program code for the explanation. It\nis difficult to show the functionality in a blog post and it may be even\nmore difficult to prevent misunderstanding as it happened with me, when\nI followed the code.\n\n::: callout-note\nNote that there are five types of callouts, including: `note`,\n`warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Tip with Title\n\nThis is an example of a callout with a title.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\" appearance=\"default\"}\n## Expand To Learn About Collapse\n\nThis is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by\nthe user. You can use `collapse=\"true\"` to collapse it by default or\n`collapse=\"false\"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by\ndefault.\n:::\n\n## Some formatting commands\n\n\n```{zsh filename=\"Terminal\"}\nquarto create-project myproject\n```\n\n",
