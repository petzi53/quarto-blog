In this second part, I will explain a simple method for\nimporting Zotero annotations into Obsidian. These Obsidian notes will\nlink to the source of the annotation (quote) in Zotero.\n\nThese backlinks are essential because one cannot always remember the\noriginal context of the citation. Especially if the creation of the\nannotation happened long ago or if the original purpose of the quote for\na specific publication/research issue has changed, you need to check and\nreassess the context of the quote. Only by looking up the annotation in\nthe source document can you prevent redundant and superfluous\ninformation from remembering the context of the quote.\n\nAfter reading and annotating, it is crucial to elaborate on the\nhighlighted content. The general strategy is to add, reformulate, and\ninclude the citations in the paper that is in progress. Whatever these\nchanges are in the initial annotations, it is vital for an efficient\nworkflow to always have a reference to the original position of the\ncitation.\n\nThere are two strategies for the integration of your \"research\nassistant\" (Zotero) with your note-taking app (Obsidian):\n\n1.  Creating a note inside Zotero and importing it into Obsidian (this\n    post).\n2.  Extracting all annotation directly from the document\n    programmatically (the third part of the annotation tutorial).\n\nIn both cases, you need to install two plugins: [Better\nBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) in Zotero and [Zotero\nIntegration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) in\nObsidian.\n\n## Notes in Zotero\n\n### Child and Standalone Notes\n\nZotero knows two types of notes. (The type names are my inventions to\nfacilitate the explanation):\n\n-   **Child Note or Items Note** belongs to the item where it was\n    created. It lives inside the Zotero item.\n-   **Standalone Notes** lives in the appropriate Zotero item collection\n    but does not belong to any specific Zotero item. This note type is\n    helpful for writing notes for multiple items.\n\nOnly the child note is an annotation because it fulfills the requirement\nof the annotation: It is anchored to specific text -- even if it\nconsists itself of (a collection of) annotations.\n\nBoth types of notes can be created either as individual notes or as a\nnote that collects all highlights:\n\n-   **Individual note**: This is a new, empty note item. You can write\n    your text into the note directly or drag and drop annotations from\n    the left column.\n-   **Highlights note**: This note collects and copies all content\n    created with the annotation types, as mentioned earlier. You are\n    always free to add or change the note content.\n\nThe distinctions between child and standalone notes are not carved in\nstone, as you can always drag a standalone note into an appropriate\nZotero item, and so it converts into a child note. You can also drag the\nchild note as an item itself in the Zotero middle pane, and so it\nconverts into a standalone note.\n\n::: {.callout-important style=\"color: red;\"}\nYou can create as many notes as you want. However, only child notes will\nbe imported into Obsidian using the Zotero Integration plugin.\n:::\n\n### How to create a child note\n\n#### Add Note from Annotations {#sec-add-note-from-annotation}\n\n1.  Select the Zotero item or the document (PDF, ePUB-eBook, website\n    snapshot) inside the Zotero item.\n2.  Open the context menu (right mouse click on my installation)\n3.  Select \"Add Note from Annotations\"\n\n#### Add (empty) Note\n\n1.  Select the Zotero item (not the document).\n2.  Open the context menu (right mouse click on my installation)\n3.  Select \"Add Note\"\n\n![How to add an empty child note: (1) Select the Zotero item (2) Open\ncontext menu and (3) Select 'Add\nNote'](zotero-integration-add-empty-child-note-min.png){#fig-empty-child-note\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows different types of annotations with Zotero in a PDF. The page is divided horizontally into three parts. From left to right: a small sidebar (about 10% width) with the content of the annotations, the document with the annotations (about 70% width), and the context pane with metadata.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nTo repeat: An \"child note\" is a note that is sorted under a Zotero item,\nindependently of where it was created initially.\n\nWe generate child notes as the easiest way to export notes into\nObsidian. This has the disadvantage that changes in the Zotero\nannotations need another export to Obsidian. We will, therefore, cover\nin the [third part of the\ntutorial](../2024-08-20-obsidian-zotero-integration-advanced) an\nalternative, a more complex way where the Obsidian plugin extracts the\nannotations programmatically from the Zotero document.\n\n## Installing Plugins\n\n### Better BibTeX and Zotero Integration\n\nFor the import of annotations into Obsidian, we need two\n<a class='glossary' title='A plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. (Wikipedia)'>plugins</a>. At the side of Zotero [Better\nBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and in Obsidian the\n[Zotero\nIntegration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).\n\n-   **Better BibTex** makes it easier to manage bibliographic data,\n    especially for people authoring documents using a text-based tool\n    chains (e.g., based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) /\n    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). This plugin has a rich\n    functionality, but we are using it for the Obsidian-Zotero\n    integration just for one feature: To create a file with citations\n    and consistent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) cite keys.\n-   **Zotero Integration** does the main work: It inserts and imports\n    citations, bibliographies, notes, and PDF annotations from Zotero\n    into Obsidian. For this functionality, it needs the installation of\n    the Better BibTeX plugin as an enhancement for Zotero.\n\n### Install \"Better BibTeX\"\n\n> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your\n> computer. Then, in Zotero, click \"Tools → Add-ons\" and drag the `.xpi`\n> onto the Add-ons window. ([Plugins for\n> Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins))\n\nTo find the latest version of the Better BibTeX `.xpi` file [click at\nthis link\nhere](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest).\n\nFor a more detailed installation procedure [see\nhere](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).\n\n### Install \"Zotero Integration\"\n\n> In Obsidian, open Settings; on the left, under Options, open Community\n> Plugins, on Community Plugins, select Browse and search for 'Zotero\n> Integration' ([Help, How do I install the\n> Plugin?](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration#help-how-do-i-install-the-plugin)).\n\nFor more details, especially troubleshooting the installation, see the\n[README file of Better\nBibTeX](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).\n\n## Zotero Integration Settings\n\nThe last task is to adapt the settings of the Obsidian Zotero\nIntegration plugin.\n\n1.  Open Preferences with the menu \"Obsidian → Preferences…\" or `CMD+,`\n    (macOS) / `CTRL+,` (Windows).\n2.  Scroll the left column down to \"Zotero Integration\" and select this\n    plugin.\n\nYou will get a window with content similar to that in\n@fig-zotero-integration-settings. The look may differ depending on the\nObsidian theme you are using. (I am using\n[Cybertron](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron))\n\n![Top part of the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin settings. For the import\nmethod explained here, you need only to complete the \"General\nSettings\".](zotero-integration-plugin-settings-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-settings\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows the general settings for importing annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nThe configuration setting page for the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin is\ncomplex. It consists of four parts:\n\n-   General Settings\n-   Citation Formats\n-   Import Formats and\n-   Import Image Settings\n\nAlthough there are many preferences for the simple import method used in\nIn this post, we will only need to complete the general settings.\n\n### General Settings\n\nThe first two settings provide the path to the main utility program for\nextracting data from PDFs.\n[pdfannots2json.js](https://github.com/mgmeyers/pdfannots2json/releases)\nshould work immediately after the installation of the \"Zotero\nIntegration\" plugin. Otherwise, you must download the tool and provide a\npath to it.\n\nIn the third field, you specify the program you will use. The plugin\nsupports Zotero and [the Jurism project](https://juris-m.github.io/),\nspecializing in legal research, and is also based on the Zotero\nreference manager. For advanced usage, you also have the option to\nspecify a custom port number. The default port where Zotero is listening\nto `23119`. You don't need to change it in a standard configuration.\nOnly for a special Zotero configuration, e.g., when using Zotero on a\nterminal server, you must provide another port number.\n\nIn the following field, you specify the path in Obsidian where the\nZotero annotations should be stored. I have used with \"zotero\" a\nsubdirectory of \"annotation\" because I have with\n[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) another app where I am importing\nannotations into Obsidian.\n\nThe following two fields determine if Obsidian should open the imported\nfile and in the case, you have imported several at once, which of the\nimported files.\n\nThe last option of the general settings is enabling the concatenation of\nannotations. Although I have turned it on, I have yet to use this\nfunctionality. Instead of concatenating files, I have used to separate\nnew data (updates) via template functions, which I will explain in the\n[third part of the\ntutorial](../2024-08-20-obsidian-zotero-integration-advanced).\n\n## Import Annotation into Obsidian without Template\n\nFor this procedure, you need to create the annotation file in Zotero\nmanually, as I have already explained in @sec-add-note-from-annotation.\n\n![Obsidian Command Palette displaying all available commands of the\nZotero Integration plugin. For some of the commands I have assigned\nhotkeys.](zotero-integration-command-palette-min.png){#fig-obsidian-command-palette\nfig-alt=\"The screenshots shows a search field with the text 'zotero inte'. Below are the found Obsidian command that contain the search string. From top to bottom: 'Zotero Integration: Bib Format'; 'Zotero Integration: Import notes' with shortcut CMD-CTRL-SHIFT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Pandoc Format' with shortcut CMD-ALT-CTRL-SHIFT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Data explorer'; 'Zotero Integration: Formatted Citation'; 'Zotero Integration: Create Literature Note' with shortcut ALT-Z; 'Zotero Integration: Formatted Bibliography'; 'Zotero Integration: Insert notes into current document' with shortcut CMD-CTRL-Z.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n1.  Now change to Obsidian and choose either \"Import notes\" or \"Insert\n    notes into the current document\" from the command palette. If you\n    attach shortcuts to these procedures, you don't need to call the\n    command using the Obsidian palette.\n2.  You have to wait until a window with the Zotero database appears,\n    where you can select the appropriate Zotero item. All note files\n    inside the Zotero item will be exported. The first command (\"Import\n    notes\") creates a new file; the second command inserts the\n    annotations into the cursor position of the current Obsidian\n    document.\n3.  The results are annotations with two links: \"Go to annotation\" and\n    the citation using the appropriate Zotero citation style. \"Go to\n    annotation\" opens the PDF and jumps to the annotation's location in\n    the original document. The citation link selects the appropriate\n    bibliography item in the Zotero middle pane.\n\n![An example of an annotation file. Every entry starts with a link to\nthe exact position of the quote and ends with a link to the bibliography\nentry in the Zotero middle pane.
