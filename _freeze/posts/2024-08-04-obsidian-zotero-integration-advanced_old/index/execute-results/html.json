You collect, read, and annotate\nscholarly articles, research papers, and books as part of your daily\nroutine. You then elaborate on this material in personal notes either\nduring the annotation process or immediately afterward.\n\nThe next step in the academic workflow involves:\n\n-   Refining and structuring the rough text passages.\n-   Incorporating feedback from peers or supervisors.\n-   Formatting them according to the publication guidelines.\n\nThese tasks can be undertaken individually or as part of a collaborative\neffort.\n\nIn this chain of timely delayed tasks, one always had to meet at least\ntwo challenges:\n\n1.  While reading and annotating, how do you know which passages would\n    later be necessary for the final publication?\n2.  Are the annotations and notes sufficient to remember the context\n    even after a long time?\n\nThese insecurities were still more cumbersome when one did not always\nhave immediate access to the original material, such as when you lent a\nbook from a library or the danger that the webpage could always\ndisappear.\n\nOne counter strategy to meet these challenges is to be safe and collect\nas much material as possible. This includes saving all relevant\nresources, making detailed annotations, and systematically organizing\nthem. But even then, finding the exact position of the text passage I\nwas looking for took time and effort.\n\nIn response to these challenges, I will introduce a solution that\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of your academic workflow,\nparticularly when you always have access to the PDF resource.\n\n## Annotations in Zotero\n\nI started using Zotero on December 30, 2007—yes, during the holidays! I\nalways use the holidays to learn new apps and try things out. My Zotero\ndatabase currently holds 5872 items created during more than 15 years of\nresearch. Until last year, I mainly used Zotero to produce correct\nformatted citations for publication. However, these changed when I\nlearned new note-taking possibilities emerged with [Zotero\n6](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-6/) (March 2022). It took me over\na year to transform my workflow. [Old habits die\nhard](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Old+Habits+Die+Hard).\n\n::: {#nte-zotero7 .callout-note}\n###### Zotero 7 update\n\nThis article focuses on the integration between\n[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).\nHowever, I will summarize some aspects of\n<a class='glossary' title='Zotero is free and open-source reference management software to manage bibliographic data and related research materials, such as PDF and ePUB files.

Almost finished with the article\non August 18, I had completely to revise the article to include the [new\nfeatures of version 7](https://www.zotero.org/support/changelog).\nWhenever it is sensible in explanations I will either add the addition\n\"(V7)\" in parenthesis to emphasize the new features of Zotero 7 or — for\na longer text passage — write another note like this one.\n:::\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Book recommendation\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-6\nFor those of you that are interested to learn more about the philosophy\nand theory of annotation, I recommend the book-length treatment\n\"Annotation\" by Remi Kalir & Antero Garcia [-@kalir2021].\n\nThere is also a\n[website](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/annotation) were you\nnot only can you read the book for free, but you can also see how\nannotations features are used for an [open peer review\nprocess](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) of the book\n[@kalir2020].\n\n::: {#def-annot .callout-important style=\"color: red;\"}\nHere, I will understand under the term \"annotation\" every addition\nanchored to the text and reinforces it. Annotations are a kind of\n[paratext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext), produced outside the\ntext but constantly referring and tied to it.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: g-col-6\n![Book cover of Annotation by Remi Kalir & Antero\nGarcia](cover-annotation-min.jpg){#fig-cover-annotation\nfig-alt=\"black background with a big red star on the lower left half.

Underlining (V7)\n\n::: {#nte-zotero-underlining .callout-note}\n###### Underlining as a new annotation type\n\nVersion 7 of Zotero supports underlining text with the eight colors\nmentioned in @fig-annotation-colors.\n\nZotero treats highlighting and underlining very similar as highlights.\nTherefore — whenever I talk about highlighting — I am referring to both\nannotation types.\n:::\n\nIt is crucial to design a consistent system when to use each color,\nbecause this will allow you to organize your annotations in Obsidian.\n\nSome people have developed a system of argumentation types to\ndistinguish the different highlighting colors. Below are two examples to\ngive you a flair for the idea.\n\n| Color   | [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2) | My own system                       |\n|:--------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|\n| Yellow  | Relevant / important                                                                | Running text                        |\n| Red     | Disagree                                                                            | Important: Concept, Definition,     |\n| Orange  | Question / confusion                                                                | ToDo                                |\n| Green   | Agree                                                                               | Resources: article/book/package/URL |\n| Blue    | Relevant to current task                                                            | \\(R\\) Code; Example                 |\n| Magenta | TODO / follow up                                                                    | Section                             |\n| Purple  | Definitions / concepts                                                              | Chapter                             |\n| Gray    | Interesting but not relevant                                                        | Figure / table title                |\n\n: Two examples of color classifications for text highlights\n{#tbl-color-classification}\n\nBoth examples stem from times before Zotero 7. Therefore there is no\ndifference and both annotation types will translate to the same meaning.\nI will explain more about the purpose of an appropriate classification\nsystem when we talk about Obsidian templates for the import of the\nZotero annotations.\n\n#### 3. \"Sticky\" notes\n\nTo add a \"sticky\" note, click on the piece of paper symbol with the\nearmark. Then, you can click on a place in the PDF to generate the note.\nA \"sticky\" note symbol appears on the page, and on the left bar, a note\nbox open for writing comments. You can move the \"sticky\" note around\ninside the page, but you can't move it to another page (therefore\n\"sticky\").\n\nThe primary purpose of \"sticky\" notes is to add a text annotation that\nrelates to the text but not to a specific passage of the text. This can\nbe, for instance, a comment on the structure of the text, a comment\nrelated to several paragraphs, a recurring argument etc.\n\n#### 4. Text (V7)\n\nWith version 7 you can also write text as an overlay directly into the\ndocument. Zotero treats this as a comment, e.g., you can add tags or\nchange the note text. But this type of annotation is very visible and\ncan moved around in the same page.\n\n#### 5. Snapshots\n\nBy clicking on the black box surrounded by a rectangular selection, you\ncan drag with the cursor to select the area of the screen to capture.\nYou can add comments and tags as in the other annotation types, but you\ncan also copy the picture or save it as a <a class='glossary' title='Portable Network Graphic (PNG) is a non-patented raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The format was not designed for professional-quality print graphics but for transferring images on the Internet (hence the name ‘portable’). (Wikipedia)'>PNG</a> file to\nyour disk.\n\n#### 6. Drawings (V7)\n\nYou pointing device (mouse, stylus, touchscreen) will be converted to a\ndrawing device by clicking on the ink button (with the drawing symbol).\nSelected the appropriate color you can now create drawings overlaying\nthe document.\n\n#### 7. Comments\n\nYou can add additional text to all types of annotations mentioned so\nfar. Zotero will treat this additional text as your comment.\n\n::: {#wrn-ID .callout-warning style=\"color: darkorange;\"}\n##### Changing highlighted text via the note?\n\nStrange enough: You can also edit the highlighted text stored as\nannotation. Frankly, I do not know appropriate use cases because, with\nthese changes, you would temper the original quote.\n:::\n\n#### 8. Tags\n\nAnother way to annotate a document is to add tags to highlighted text,\n\"sticky\" notes, screenshots, or comments.\n\nInside the document (e.g., whenever the PDF document is open and visible\nin the middle pane), you can select all annotations with the same tag.\nColors work as a tag, too. Hence, you can select all highlighted text in\nthe same color. You can also combine different tags. For instance, two\ntext tags with two colors will select all annotations that have one of\nthese text tags or one of the chosen colors.\n\nOutside the document, the tag works as a standard document tag in the\ntag pane at the bottom of the left column. Although the tags are\nattached to specific annotations outside the PDF (e.g., in the tag\npane), they will select only the Zotero item with the document where the\ntag was used and not the appropriate annotations. But if you use the\nsame tag for annotation in different documents, Zotero will open all\nitems where these tags were applied.\n\nWe will see that after the export to Obsidian, these annotated tags gain\npower as the work across all Obsidian documents!\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Zotero documentation is not yet up-to-date so that detailed\ninformation are still lacking or not completely correct. For instance is\n[The Zotero PDF Reader and Note\nEditor](https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader) talking only about\nthe PDF reader (version 6). The best page so far is the announcement\npage [Zotero 7: Zotero,\nredesigned](https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/). I am sure that in\nseveral weeks there will be many YouTube tutorials to explain the\ndetails for Zotero version 7.\n\nIn the meanwhile the following annotated screenshot may be helpful. It\nrecapitulates graphically the above textual description.\n\n![Screenshot of Zotero Reader and Note Editor with explanations of the\ngraphical user interface (<a class='glossary' title='A graphical user interface (GUI) is an operating system interface that enables user interactions with an electronic device through icons, images, and other graphical elements G2.'>GUI</a>). Click on the image to\nenlarge\nit.](Screenshot-WIR-2022-Zotero-Skitch-min.png){#fig-zotero-annotations\nfig-alt=\"The screenshots shows three horizontally divided panes: Left are the annotations, in the center is the content of the PDF file and right are ten annotations collected as a separate note item.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" group=\"zotero-annotation\"}\n\n## Notes in Zotero\n\n### Child and Standalone Notes\n\nZotero knows two types of notes. (The type names are my inventions to\nfacilitate the explanation):\n\n-   **Child Note or Items Note** belongs to the item where it was\n    created. It lives inside the Zotero item.\n-   **Standalone Notes** lives in the appropriate Zotero item collection\n    but does not belong to any specific Zotero item. This note type is\n    helpful for writing notes for multiple items.\n\nOnly the child note is an annotation because it fulfills the requirement\nof the annotation @def-annot: It is anchored to specific text -- even if\nit consists itself of (a collection of) annotations.\n\nBoth types of notes can be created either as individual notes or as a\nnote that collects all highlights:\n\n-   **Individual note**: This is a new, empty note item. You can write\n    your text into the note directly, or you can also drag and drop\n    annotations from the left column.\n-   **Highlights note**: This note collects and copies all content\n    created with the annotation types, as mentioned earlier.\n\n### How to create a child note\n\nBut the distinction between individual and highlight notes is not carved\nin stone, as you can always add text or other types of annotations into\nnotes or drag the complete note as an item itself in the Zotero middle\npane.\n\nTo get into the start position for the following graphics, you have to\nselect a PDF attached to a Zotero item element by double-clicking on the\nitem or the PDF inside the item.\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-1\n:::\n\n::: g-col-5\n![How to add item notes](zotero-add-note-skitch-min.png){#fig-14-04\nfig-alt=\"alt-text\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"95%\"\ngroup=\"zotero-annotation\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-4\n1.  Click on the notepad symbol on the right pane to open the note tab.\n2.  Click on the upper +-sign button to open the drop-down menu and\n    choose \"Add Item Note\" to create an empty note or \"Add Item Note\n    from Annotations\" to create a note with all the PDF annotations.\n:::\n\n::: g-col-1\n:::\n:::\n\nThe action above results in the view of the right pane in\n@fig-zotero-annotations. The text in parenthesis in \"Added (external)\nitem note from annotation\" refers to the note generated from the\nannotations created and edited on the left pane. This is in contrast to\nthe (internal) annotations inside the PDF. Typically, there shouldn't be\nany difference, but I mentioned that you can edit the highlighted text.\nIn that particular case, there is a difference between external and\ninternal annotations.\n\nTo repeat: An \"item note\" is a note that is sorted under a Zotero item,\nindependently of where it was created initially. The plus sign under the\n\"All Notes\" header creates a standalone note sorted at the top of the\nappropriate folder/collection. This standalone note can be empty or\ngenerate external annotations like the item note.\n\nWe generate an item/child note as the easiest way to export notes into\nObsidian. This has the disadvantage that changes in the Zotero\nannotations need another export to Obsidian. We will, therefore, cover\nan alternative -- more complex way -- where the Obsidian plugin extracts\nthe annotations directly from the PDF.\n\n## Installing Plugins\n\n### Better BibTeX and Zotero Integration\n\nFor the import of annotations into Obsidian, we need two\n<a class='glossary' title='A plug-in (or plugin, add-in, addin, add-on, or addon) is a software component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. (Wikipedia)'>plugins</a>. At the side of Zotero [Better\nBibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) and in Obsidian the\n[Zotero\nIntegration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration).\n\n-   **Better BibTex** makes it easier to manage bibliographic data,\n    especially for people authoring documents using text-based tool\n    chains (e.g., based on [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) /\n    [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)). This plugin has a rich\n    functionality, but we are using it for the Obsidian-Zotero\n    integration just for one feature: To create a file with citations\n    and consistent [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) cite keys.\n-   **Zotero Integration** does the main work: It inserts and imports\n    citations, bibliographies, notes, and PDF annotations from Zotero\n    into Obsidian. For this functionality, it needs the installation of\n    the Better BibTeX plugin as an enhancement for Zotero.\n\n### How to install \"Better BibTeX\" plugin\n\n> To install a plugin in Zotero, download its `.xpi` file to your\n> computer. Then, in Zotero, click \"Tools → Add-ons\" and drag the `.xpi`\n> onto the Add-ons window. ([Plugins for\n> Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins))\n\nTo find the latest version of the Better BibTeX `.xpi` file [click at\nthis link\nhere](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases/latest).\n\nFor a more detailed installation procedure [see\nhere](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).\n\n### How to install \"Zotero Integration\" plugin\n\n> In Obsidian, open Settings, on the left under Options open Community\n> Plugins, on Community Plugins select Browse and search for 'Zotero\n> Integration' ([Help, How do I install the\n> Plugin?](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration#help-how-do-i-install-the-plugin)).\n\nFor more details, especially troubleshooting the installation, see the\n[README file of Better\nBibTeX](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration?tab=readme-ov-file).\n\n## Zotero Integration Settings\n\nThe last task is to adapt the settings of the Obsidian Zotero\nIntegration plugin.\n\n1.  Open Preferences with the menu \"Obsidian → Preferences…\" or `CMD+,`\n    (macOS) / `CTRL+,` (Windows).\n2.  Scroll the left column down to \"Zotero Integration\" and select this\n    plugin.\n\nYou will get a window with a similar content as in\n@fig-zotero-integration-settings. The look may differ depending on the\nObsidian theme you are using. (I am using\n[Cybertron](https://github.com/nickmilo/Cybertron))\n\n![Top part of the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin\nsettings](Zotero-Integration-Settings-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-settings\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows the general settings for importing annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nThe configuration setting page for the \"Zotero Integration\" plugin is\ncomplex. It consists of four parts:\n\n-   General Settings\n-   Citation Formats and\n-   Import Formats\n-   Import Image Settings\n\nAlthough there are many preferences the most import part are the general\nsettings. To scrap the annotations from PDFs inside Zotero items PDFs\nwithout specifying details of the import format you just need to\ncomplete the general settings.\n\nI will skip here the part on \"Citation Formats\". This section uses the\nintegration with Zotero to produce different kinds of citations formats\ninside Obsidian. With the exception of \"Formatted Bibliography\" these\nformats produces code within Obsidian that are usable for further\nconversion resp. export procedures.\n\n### General Settings\n\nThe first two settings provide the path to the main utility program for\nextracting data from PDFs.\n[pdfannots2json.js](https://github.com/mgmeyers/pdfannots2json/releases)\nshould work immediately after the installation of the \"Zotero\nIntegration\" plugin. Otherwise you have to download the tool and provide\na path to it.\n\nIn the third field you specify the program you are going to use. The\nplugin supports beside Zotero also [the Jurism\nproject](https://juris-m.github.io/), specialized for legal research but\nalso based on the Zotero reference manager. For advanced usage you have\nalso the option to specify a custom port number. The default port where\nZotero is listening is `23119`. You need to change it only for a special\nZotero configuration, e.g., when you are using Zotero on a terminal\nserver.\n\nIn the next field you specify the path in Obsidian where the Zotero\nannotations should be stored. I have used with \"zotero\" a subdirectory\nof \"annotation\" because I have with\n[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) another app where I am importing\nannotations into Obsidian.\n\nThe next two fields determine if Obsidian should open the imported file\nand in the case you have imported several at once, which of the imported\nfiles.\n\nThe last option of the general settings is the possibility to enable\nconcatenation of annotation. Although I have it turned on I haven't used\nthis functionality so far. Instead to concatenate files I have used to\nseparate new data (updates) via a template functions, which I will\nexplain in the last section of this article.\n\n### Import Formats\n\n![The first part of the import options for annotated PDF\nfiles.](Zotero-Import-Format-1-min.png){#fig-zotero-import-1\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows the first part of the import options for annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n**Name**: The first field is a name for the import options. I have\nchosen with \"Create Literature Note\" a long name. For easier use I have\nassigned it with `ALT-Z` a shortcut (\"hotkey\" in Obsidian parlance).\n\n**Output path**: The \"Output Path\" as the second field is partially\nredundant as one needs to repeat the already defined path in the general\nsettings. Only the last part of the path is new and specifies the name\nof the imported file. I have followed the recommendation by the plugin\ndeveloper and used the `{{citekey}}` variable prepended by a `@`.\n\nThis is a nice trick as the difference between an inline citation in\nObsidian (e.g., `[@piketty2022]`) and a literature note using Zotero\n(e.g., `[[@piketty2022]]`) is only a matter of additional square\nbrackets. If you hover with the mouse over these citation codes Obsidian\noffers you three choices:\n\n::: grid\n::: g-col-4\n![Link to the annotated literature file in\nObsidian](Obsidian-link-to-literature-note-min.png){fig-alt=\"alt-text\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-4\n![Link to the Zotero item in your Zotero\ndatabase](Obsidian-link-to-Zotero-item-min.png){fig-alt=\"alt-text\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n:::\n\n::: g-col-4\n![Link to open the original\nPDF](Obsidian-link-to-PDF-file-min.png){fig-alt=\"alt-text\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n**Image Output Path**: The \"Select Area\" tool in Zotero produces\n<a class='glossary' title='Portable Network Graphic (PNG) is a non-patented raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression.

(Wikipedia)'>JPG</a> files. The last item of the\nimage output path is the name of a folder storing one or more images\nfrom the Zotero annotation file.\n\n**Image Base Name**: The file name of annotated Zotero images is\nconstructed by page number followed by the X and Y coordinates,\nseparated by dashes. You can also specify a base name that will be\nplaced as the first part of the name.\n\n**Template File**: It is possible to give the plugin specified\ninstruction how to convert the annotation by using different kind of\nvariables. I will dedicate an extra section for the explanation of this\nmost advanced but also most complex feature of the Zotero Integration\nplugin.\n\nIt is possible to import the Zotero annotations in a kind of default\nmodus without specifying a template. In this case you use the command\n`Import Notes` or `Import notes into current document`. If you want to\nuse your template than you provide the name of the import section as\ndefined in the first field of the Import Formats section of the\nsettings.\n\n**Bibliography Style**: The last field in the Import Formats section is\nthe style specification of the CSL you are using in Zotero. There are\nnow more than 10.000 citation styles available in the [Zotero Style\nRepository](https://www.zotero.org/styles). For details of the\ninstallation procedure of citation styles read the [Zotero help\nfile](https://www.zotero.org/support/styles).\n\n### Import Image Settings\n\n![Screenshot of import image options of the Zotero Integration\nplugin](Zotero-Import-Format-2-min.png){#fig-zotero-import-2\nfig-alt=\"The screenshot shows the last part of the import options for annotated PDF files. The different fields are explained in the text.\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\nUsing the rectangle tool \"Select Area\" will produce images. In this last\npart of the settings of the Zotero Integration plugin you can determine\ndetails for this screenshot facility.\n\nIn the first part of the import image settings you can choose the image\nformat (<a class='glossary' title='Portable Network Graphic (PNG) is a non-patented raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. The format was not designed for professional-quality print graphics but for transferring images on the Internet (hence the name ‘portable’). (Wikipedia)'>PNG</a> or <a class='glossary' title='JPEG (/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡ/ JAY-peg, short for Joint Photographic Experts Group is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images. (Wikipedia)'>JPG</a>), set the image\nquality and the dots per image (<a class='glossary' title='DPI is used to measure the resolution of an image both on screen and in print. It refers to the number of printed dots contained within one inch (2.54cm) of an image printed by a printer.'>DPI</a>).\n\nThe second part is only of importance if you want to extract text from\nimages. This option needs the path to <a class='glossary' title='Tesseract is a free software for optical character recognition (OCR) for various operating systems. An R package with the same name supports over 100 languages.'>Tesseract</a>,\nlanguage lexicons for the interpretation and the path to the data\n(lexicons) directory.\n\nAs there exists different R packages for <a class='glossary' title='Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast) ([Wikipedia](Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast)(Wikipedia)'>OCR</a>\n([pdftools](https://docs.ropensci.org/pdftools/),\n[Rpoppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/),\n[tesseract](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tesseract/vignettes/intro.html#read_from_pdf_files),\n[tabulizer](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/tabulizer/))\nI haven't used this Obsidian function so far.\n\n## Import Annotation into Obsidian\n\n### Without Template\n\nAs I have already mentioned: There is an easy way --- without using\ntemplates --- to import Zotero annotation into Obsidian. For this\nprocedure you need to create the annotation file in Zotero manually.\n\n![Obsidian [Command\nPalette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) displaying\nall available commands of the Zotero Integration plugin. For some of the\ncommands I have assigned\nhotkeys.](Zotero-Integration-Command-Palette-min.png){fig-alt=\"alt-text\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n1.  Select the Zotero item (not the PDF!)\n2.  Open the context menu with a right mouse click\n3.  Choose \"Add Note from Annotations\" This produces and opens a note\n    with the name \"Annotation\" and the date time of the creation. You\n    can inspect and even change the content in the right Zotero pane.\n4.  Now change to Obsidian and choose either \"Import notes\" or \"Insert\n    notes into current document\" from the command palette. If you attach\n    shortcuts to these procedures you don't need to call the command\n    palette in Obsidian and select the correct command.\n5.  You have to wait until a window with the Zotero database appears,\n    where you can select the appropriate Zotero item. All note files\n    inside the Zotero item will be exported. The first command (\"Import\n    notes\") creates a new file; the second command inserts the\n    annotations into the cursor position of the current Obsidian\n    document.\n6.  The result are annotations with two links: \"Go to annotation\" and\n    the citation using the appropriate Zotero citation style. \"Go to\n    annotation\" opens the PDF and jumps to the citation. The citation\n    link selects the appropriate bibliography item in the Zotero middle\n    pane.\n\n![An example of an annotation file. Every entry starts with a link to\nthe exact position of the quote and ends with a link to the bibliography\nentry in the Zotero middle pane. Between these two links is the\nannotated text passage surrounded by quotation\nmarks.](Annotation-Example-without-Template-min.png){fig-alt=\"alt-text\"\nfig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\" group=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n### With Template\n\n#### Introduction\n\nAlthough all annotations are imported into Obsidian without templates,\nyou will loose many <a class='glossary' title='Metadata (or metainformation) is “data that provides information about other data” (Merriam-Webster), but not the content of the data itself, such as the text of a message or the image itself. (Wikipedia)'>metadata</a> of your notes. Without a\ntemplate your are missing two types of metadata:\n\n-   Metadata about the Zotero bibliography item (author, title, year,\n    publisher, location, abstract, item tags etc.)\n-   Metadata about the annotation (colors and tags of the annotations)\n\nYou also loose control where to store the files notes and images\n(default: your attachment folder) and to store images as JPG (default:\nPNG).\n\nCreate a Zotero Integration template is a difficult process for two\nreasons:\n\n1.  You have to know how to apply the\n    [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)\n    syntax. Nunjucks is a JavaScript templating language, supported by\n    all modern browsers.\n2.  You have to know the names of the variables to import. You can\n    inspect the variable names with the \"Data Explorer\" command of the\n    Zotero Integration plugin.\n\n![Part of the Data Explorer for the Zotero Integration plugin. You can\nopen / close hierarchical values by clicking on the small triangle as is\nshown in the middle of the screenshot with\n\"creators\".](Zotero-Integration-Data-Explorer-min.png){#fig-zotero-integration-data-explorer\nfig-alt=\"alt-text\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"\ngroup=\"zotero-integration\"}\n\n#### Examples\n\nThe best way to learn how to apply the Nunjucks template language is to\nexperiments with examples developed by other people. I have collected\nseveral Zotero Integration template examples.\n\n::: my-resource\n::: my-resource-header\n::: {#lem-nunjucks-templates}\n: Examples for Nunjucks templates\n:::\n:::\n\n::: my-resource-container\n-   [Doing History with Zotero and\n    Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/history-notes/01+Notetaking+for+Historians):\n    A very detailed article which not only contains a template example\n    but also explains the whole integration process similar like this\n    post here [@razglova2023].\n\n-   [An Updated Academic Workflow: Zotero &\n    Obsidian](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd):\n    A detailed explanation of the whole process with a sophisticated\n    Zotero Integration template [@phelan2024a].\n\n-   There is collection of several templates in an important [Obsidian\n    Forum\n    post](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310).\n    As there are many posts about general questions how to apply the\n    templates, I will list some posts that include template code for you\n    to experiment:\n\n    -   [mgmeyers](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/2):\n        A very fine and detailed template form the author of the Zotero\n        Integration plugin.
