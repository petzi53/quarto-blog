Pandoc is licensed with the very permissive GNU1 General Public License (GPL). Currently, Pandoc supports the conversion of more than 60 formats. John MacFarlane, a philosophy professor at the University of Berkeley, is developing and maintaining Pandoc.\nRStudio IDE ships with a pandoc binary. The path is stored in the RSTUDIO_PANDOC environment variable. You can get the path and the current pandoc version used by RStudio with rmarkdown::find_pandoc().\n\nrmarkdown::find_pandoc()\n\n$version\n[1] '3.2.1'\n\n$dir\n[1] \"/usr/local/bin\"\n\n\nTo get the version number on your machine type in the terminal:\n\n\nTerminal (slightly redacted\n\npandoc --version\n(base) path@my_machine quarto-blog % pandoc --version\npandoc 3.1.2\nFeatures: +server +lua\nScripting engine: Lua 5.4\nUser data directory: /Users/path@my_direcotry/.pandoc\nCopyright (C) 2006-2023 John MacFarlane.

The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. … [O]ne can use either attributes in curly braces or a single unbraced word, which will be treated as a class name. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The fenced Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. From Extension: fenced_divs\n\nTwo more remarks:\n\nIf you are going to nest pandoc div directives, you must provide more colons for the outer divs than the inner divs.\nTo prevent that Quarto uses the jupyter engine, you must provide engine: knitr in the YAML front matter."

    "text": "A genuine Quarto solution\nAfter I looked around at how to create a two-text column layout for a while, I found a simple Quarto answer. Hidden in the help page about figures, I found the remark:\n\nYou can treat any markdown content you want as a figure by enclosing it in Pandoc div block with an identifier prefaced with #fig-. See the first sentence under the header Figure Divs.\n\nThe first part of the sentence, “You can treat any markdown content you want as a figure…” could be reversed to the concept that a layout for figures works similarly to a design for text.\nI came up with the following solution that I also published to answer the StackOverflow post.\n\nVersion 1 with equally wide columns\n\n---\ntitle: \"Two columns layout Quarto with equally wide columns\"\nformat: html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n\nFirst column\n\nSecond column\n\nI would like to have text here\n\nand here\n\nSentence becomes longer, it should automatically stay in their column\n\nMore text\n\n:::\nThe above solution uses the Quarto layout-ncol attribute. There is also a layout-nrowattribute. In both directives, you can specify the number of columns respectively rows.\n\n\nVersion 2 with different wide columns\n---\ntitle: \"Two columns layout Quarto with different wide columns\"\nformat: html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n::: {layout=\"[[10,5], [40,20], [26,13], [2,1]]\"}\n\n\n**First column**\n\n**Second column**\n\nI would like to have text here\n\nand here\n\nSentence becomes longer, it should automatically stay in their column\n\nMore text\n\n:::\nThe version 2 solution uses the general form of the layout attribute. It is followed by a 2-dimensional array where the first dimension defines rows and the second columns. Note that the used row / column numbers in the second version are arbitrary. They just provide the desired proportion of 2:1. The code translates to “create four rows, where the first column has always the double size of the second column.”\nSome final remarks on both of the last examples:\n\nThere needs to be an empty line between every paragraph (here sentence). This structure is necessary so Pandoc can see the break and addresses the next column.\nYou need to use the engine: knitr command to prevent rendering with the jupyter engine."

After continuously struggling with the complex machinery blogdown - Hugo - Wowchemy, I feel like coming home from a trip abroad!\nFollowing the Quarto guide Creating a Blog, it took me only 2 (!) minutes to render the provided blog template locally. After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and Netlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for my blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web presences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a GitHub account, GitHub credential, and a Netlify account. And I didn’t work on the content of a blog entry but used just the installed test pages.)\nI never was happy with the rapid development of Hugo that brought with it many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem happened with the Academic theme by Wowchemy. The end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten some of the many details for a good-looking blog post after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time learning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive subjects.\nIt was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced `blogdown::checksite()` and the possibility of freezing to a specific Hugo version. But the work in the blogdown-Hugo environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it’s self-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for over two years now states as a note from the authors: “Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the blogdown package.”"

At the moment, my feeling is enthusiastic: It is easy and intuitive to write on this platform. I hope to overcome technical barriers and concentrate on thematic topics finally. Since English is not my mother tongue, it is already difficult enough to express myself precisely about complex content-related questions. I don’t need any additional technical difficulty in writing blog posts.\nIn contrast to my previous website projects, I am planning two different strategies: \n\nI will not go into the details of the website design immediately but will work on these issues from time to time.\nI will not announce the website until I am sure I will use it regularly and long-term. I think that about 10 articles – written in two months – should give me the trust that I will use it sustainably."

As head of the Department of Interactive Media and Educational Technologies at the University for Continuing Education Krems (UWK) (Austria), I researched how to apply technology in settings of Life Long Learning. \nI had held positions as a professor at several universities in Austria and Germany (Klagenfurt, Münster, Innsbruck, Hagen) before I accepted the nomination to Krems. I published 25 books (10 monographs and 15 edited volumes) and over 200 articles.\nWith my retirement, I became a Life Long Learner myself. I am interested in studying workflows for Open Science research, focusing on note-taking apps like Obsidian, Hypothes.is, etc., and the R programming language for statistical computing and data science.\n\n\n Back to top"
