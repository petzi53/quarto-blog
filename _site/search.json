I think that about 10 articles – written in two months – should give me the trust that I will use it sustainably."

After continuously struggling with the complex machinery blogdown - Hugo - Wowchemy, I feel like coming home from a trip abroad!\nFollowing the Quarto guide Creating a Blog, it took me only 2 (!) minutes to render the provided blog template locally. After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and Netlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for my blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web presences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a GitHub account, GitHub credential, and a Netlify account.)\nI never was happy with the rapid development of Hugo that brought with it many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem happened with the Academic theme by Wowchemy. The end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten some of the many details after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time learning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive subjects.\nIt was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced `blogdown::checksite()` and the possibility of freezing to a specific Hugo version. But the work in this environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it’s self-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for over two years now states as a note from the authors: “Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the blogdown package.”\n\n\n\nScreenshot from the introductory note by the authors of blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"
