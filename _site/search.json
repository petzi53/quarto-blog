    "text": "This is my first entry in a new blog powered by Quarto. After continuously struggling with the complex machinery blogdown - Hugo - Wowchemy, I feel like coming home from a trip abroad!\nFollowing the Quarto guide Creating a Blog, it took me only 2 (!) minutes to render the provided blog template locally. After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and Netlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for my blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web presences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a GitHub account, GitHub credential, and a Netlify account.)\nI never was happy with the rapid development of Hugo that brought with it many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem happened with the Academic theme by Wowchemy. The end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten some of the many details after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time learning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive subjects.\nIt was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced `blogdown::checksite()` and the possibility of freezing the used Hugo version. But the work in this environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it’s self-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for over two years now states as a note from the authors: “Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the blogdown package.”\n\n\n\nScreenshot from the introductory note by the authors of “blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown”\n\n\nI am sure there will also be some intricacies I have to learn and overcome, but this will conform with all my other R knowledge. At the moment, my feeling is enthusiastic: It is easy and intuitive to write on this platform. I hope to finally overcome technical barriers and concentrate on thematic topics. Since English is not my mother tongue, it is already difficult enough to express yourself nuancedly about complex content-related questions. I really don’t need any additional technical difficulty."
