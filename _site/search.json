Pandoc is licensed with the very permissive GNU1 General Public License (GPL). Currently, Pandoc supports the conversion of more than 60 formats. John MacFarlane, a philosophy professor at the University of Berkeley, is developing and maintaining Pandoc.\nRStudio IDE ships with a pandoc binary. The path is stored in the RSTUDIO_PANDOC environment variable. You can get the path and the current pandoc version used by RStudio with rmarkdown::find_pandoc().\n\nrmarkdown::find_pandoc()\n\n$version\n[1] '3.2.1'\n\n$dir\n[1] \"/usr/local/bin\"\n\n\nTo get the version number on your machine type in the terminal:\n\n\nTerminal (slightly redacted)\n\npandoc --version\n(base) path@my_machine quarto-blog % pandoc --version\npandoc 3.1.2\nFeatures: +server +lua\nScripting engine: Lua 5.4\nUser data directory: /Users/path@my_direcotry/.pandoc\nCopyright (C) 2006-2023 John MacFarlane.

The attributes may optionally be followed by another string of consecutive colons. … [O]ne can use either attributes in curly braces or a single unbraced word, which will be treated as a class name. The Div ends with another line containing a string of at least three consecutive colons. The fenced Div should be separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks. From Extension: fenced_divs\n\nTwo more remarks:\n\nIf you are going to nest pandoc div directives, you must provide more colons for the outer divs than the inner divs.\nTo prevent that Quarto uses the jupyter engine, you must provide engine: knitr in the YAML front matter."

    "text": "A genuine Quarto solution\nAfter I looked around at how to create a two-text column layout for a while, I found a simple Quarto answer. Hidden in the help page about figures, I found the remark:\n\nYou can treat any markdown content you want as a figure by enclosing it in Pandoc div block with an identifier prefaced with #fig-. See the first sentence under the header Figure Divs.\n\nThe first part of the sentence, “You can treat any markdown content you want as a figure…” could be reversed to the concept that a layout for figures works similarly to a design for text.\nI came up with the following solution that I also published to answer the StackOverflow post.\n\nVersion 1 with equally wide columns\n\n---\ntitle: \"Two columns layout Quarto with equally wide columns\"\nformat: html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n\nFirst column\n\nSecond column\n\nI would like to have text here\n\nand here\n\nSentence becomes longer, it should automatically stay in their column\n\nMore text\n\n:::\nThe above solution uses the Quarto layout-ncol attribute. There is also a layout-nrowattribute. In both directives, you can specify the number of columns respectively rows.\n\n\nVersion 2 with different wide columns\n---\ntitle: \"Two columns layout Quarto with different wide columns\"\nformat: html\nengine: knitr\n---\n\n::: {layout=\"[[10,5], [40,20], [26,13], [2,1]]\"}\n\n\n**First column**\n\n**Second column**\n\nI would like to have text here\n\nand here\n\nSentence becomes longer, it should automatically stay in their column\n\nMore text\n\n:::\nThe version 2 solution uses the general form of the layout attribute. It is followed by a 2-dimensional array where the first dimension defines rows and the second columns. Note that the used row / column numbers in the second version are arbitrary. They just provide the desired proportion of 2:1. The code translates to “create four rows, where the first column has always the double size of the second column.”\nSome final remarks on both of the last examples:\n\nThere needs to be an empty line between every paragraph (here sentence). This structure is necessary so Pandoc can see the break and addresses the next column.\nYou need to use the engine: knitr command to prevent rendering with the jupyter engine."

The problem was a certain kind of perfectionism: I thought that my knowledge about R issues was not deep enough to be interesting to other people. After visiting the useR!2024 conference, I changed my view in four aspects:\n\nR has a dynamic community where new people are constantly attracted. My meager knowledge could be helpful, especially for beginners, as I was struggling with the same starter issues not long ago. Sometimes, a person with intermediate knowledge can be more beneficial than an expert.\nThe R project is a very complex field. Nobody has the same level of expert knowledge in every area. Therefore, it is possible that some parts of my knowledge could be useful for other people, even if they are (in other areas or generally) much more advanced.\nPutting my understanding into words so that other people can use this information for their project is an important exercise: It ensures that I have grasped the essentials and fosters my learning by writing down all the necessary details.\nThe most important reason to write blog posts about issues I have learned is the “Future me.” After several months of working on other topics, I often notice that I have forgotten some details of procedures I have already learned.\n\nTo elaborate on the last point: In one case, I was looking for a solution to a problem I experienced. After several web searches, I found the solution on StackOverflow. I was shocked when I noticed that it was me who wrote the correct answer several years ago!"

I noticed that there are two versions: One published via Netlify and another one – already pretty elaborated – locally.\n\nLooking for a glitch\nThe local version had a small but annoying flaw. It displayed three colons ::: at the beginning of the listing on the homepage and at the end of every post. I knew that ::: represents special fenced syntax for native Div blocks in pandoc.\nWhatever I tried, I could not find the problem and solve it.\n\nI looked into all articles to see if there was a redundant fenced syntax symbol.\nI set for all posts draft: true.\nI even cloned the remote repo only to get the same behavior.\n\n\n\nStarting from scratch\nAnother drawback was that I did not understand many code lines, especially in _quarto.yml but also in posts/_metadata.yml and in the main index.qmd.\nFinally, I decided to start with a new blog. I created a new repo with a different name, initiated a new RStudio project, and so on. As a surplus, I documented every single step. I wrote extensive notes and shot screenshots of every necessary action. After each tiny change, I checked the results by rendering the blog.\n\n\nLesson learned\nAs a result, I have extensive material to explain how to initialize a Quarto blog, which I will publish in several posts in the next few days. And I finally found the reason for the surplus fenced div!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1: href-URLs without quotation marks in YAML file\n\n\n\n\n\nThe URLs of the right part of the footer text were incorrectly in quotation marks. This would be a perfect passage in HTML, but it was inappropriate as a Quarto directive.\nI wrote:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n    right:\n      - text: Proudly powered by &lt;a href=\"https://quarto.org/\"&gt;Quarto&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstead of:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\n    right:\n      - text: Proudly powered by &lt;a href=https://quarto.org/&gt;Quarto&lt;/a&gt;"

Have a look into the “posts” folder by selecting the “Files” tab in the bottom right pane of RStudio and click on the “posts” folder to open the directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Content of the posts folder immediately after the initialization process\n\n\n\nThe two folders “post-with-code” and “welcome” contain the two dummy articles generated automatically in the initialization process. I will explain the function of the _metadata.yml file later in another post.\nBesides to list all articles of a folder, you can also write much more complex rules for including content by using globs and a list of targets in the contents directive.

See for more information on article layout.\nThe full layout uses the article grid system but automatically expands the content area to use the sidebar and margin region if no content is placed within those regions. This is useful for layouts that don’t need to be constrained to reading width, and that will benefit from additional horizontal space (e.g., landing or index pages). It is also often appropriate for listing pages.\nThe custom layout provides the possibility to create an individual layout. Learn more on the Page Layout page."

    "text": "Research on Social Inequality\nI plan to write blog articles about social inequality in Austria, my native country. To be innovative, I want to avoid repeating what other people (journalists, scientists) were saying (claiming) but to illustrate my thinking backed by original data. But where does the data come from?\n\nSome Data Resources for Inequality Research\n\n\n\nResource 1 : Some Data Resources for Inequality Research\n\n\n\n\nWID: The World Inequality Database (WID) aims to provide open and convenient access to the most extensive available database on the historical evolution of the world distribution of income and wealth, both within countries and between countries (Author Collective ’World Inequality Lab’ 2024).\nOWID: Our World In Data (OWID) is an online publication that focuses on large global problems such as poverty, disease, hunger, climate change, war, existential risks, and inequality (Global Change Data Lab and Roser 2024).\nPIP: The Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) is an interactive computational tool that offers users quick access to the World Bank’s estimates of poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity. PIP provides a comprehensive view of global, regional, and country-level trends for more than 160 economies around the World (World Bank 2024).\nLIS: The Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS) is a data archive and research center dedicated to cross-national analysis. It is home to the Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS) and the Luxembourg Wealth Study Database (LWS) (LIS Author Collective 2024).\n\n\n\n\n\nWID & A Brief History of Equality\nUnderstanding the use of all these data resources is a complex enterprise. As a starting point, I will concentrate on the World Inequality Database (WID) because there exist several monographs where these data are used and interpreted.\nAs a first step, I am going to follow the arguments of one book that I will use as advanced organizer. I am referring to “A Brief History of Equality” (BHE), which is only 274 pages, is a kind of executive summary of previous books by Thomas Piketty: “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” (816 pages) and “Capital and Ideology” (1093 pages) (Piketty 2020; Piketty and Goldhammer 2017).\n\n\nLacking Graphs about Austria\nMost of the time, BHE uses global, regional, or data from big, respectively ‘important’ countries like China, France, Germany, India, United Kingdom, United States, etc. Data on Austria and its interpretation are missing from the mentioned book and most scientific publications referenced on the website. An exception is the working paper “Distributional National Accounts (DINA)” for Austria, 2004-2016 by Jestl and List (2020). But this paper partly uses different indices and different concepts (for instance, the Gini coefficient).\nOn the WID website there are two other articles where at least Austria is shown in some graphs: You will find five figures with Austria data in “What’s New About Income Inequality in Europe (1980-2019)?” by Morgan and Neef (2020) and other two figures in “How Unequal Is Europe? Evidence from Distributional National Accounts, 1980-2017” by Blanchet, Chancel, and Gethin (2019).\nSo, creating figures with Austrian data is not only an excellent exercise but the result could also increase our knowledge about the mechanisms and patterns of social inequality."

    "text": "Using the WID website\n\nKey resources\nTo get started effectively, one has to overcome a paradoxical situation: The more detailed the methodological guidelines, the more difficult it is to find an appropriate entry point to get started.\n\n\n\nResource 2 : Methodological Guidelines & Other Resources\n\n\n\n\nDistributional National Accounts (DINA) Guidelines: This is the central resource for understanding the methodology behind the decomposition of national accounts and the inequality series for income and wealth. The purpose of these Distributional National Accounts (DINA) guidelines is to present the concepts, data sources, and methods used in the World Inequality Database (WID). It is a long document with 186 pages (Blanchet et al. 2024).\nCodes Dictionary (Code Book): It describes the general structure of the World Inequality Database (WID). It explains how information is organized within it and how to retrieve and interpret its content. This document is invaluable for getting familiarized with the construction of WID variables and the structure of the database (World Inequality Lab 2024). Converting the web page into a PDF results in a document of 18 pages.\nSummary Table: It summarizes all available WID.world data. The search tool can look for specific countries, variables, or WID.world codes. It has currently 6253 rows and 16 columns. The summary table is an efficient starting point because it allows for a view of available data, which one can then download for more detailed analysis.\nComputer Code: On the GitHub platform, you can inspect and fork the repository that contains all the code used to create the entire database from both the researcher’s data and official sources. It consists of 98% of STATA code, the rest (only 2%) is written in R. 1\nData: There are two ways to download data:\n\nDirect Download: The interactive page allows one to select the required data and download it in the format that best suits one’s needs.\nAdvanced Interfaces: For special requirements, one can access the data with STATA or R interfaces. In the case of the R interface, one can download from GitHub the R {wid} package (Blanchet 2024a).\n\n\n\n\nIt is a lot of work to read all the necessary information before starting. Instead of using this (tedious) sequential approach, I will try an interactive procedure, iteratively changing between theory (methodological guidelines) and practice (using R to replicate the figure).\n\n\nReplicating income distribution\n\nFigure to replicate\nAs my test bed, I will use Figure 7 of BHE (Piketty 2022, 46).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure 7 of BHE, taken from the original source on Piketty’s website.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive Replication\nAs a first approach, I will replicate Figure 7 of BHE with the provided interactive tools of the WID. Here is a good starting point for income inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Choosing France as “Country” and using the default values for income inequality (top 10% share and bottom 50% share)\n\n\n\nFrom here, I will show screenshots for every step necessary to replicate Figure 7 of BHE, but here in this post, it is Figure 1. If you click on one of the small images below, it will open the figure in the bigger original size, and you can navigate back and forth between the figures in the table below.\n\n\nFigures 3-6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Choosing France as “Country” and using the default values for income inequality (top 10% share and bottom 50% share).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Enlarge the time span of the data from 1947 to 1820 with the bottom slider.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Hiding the extrapolations (dotted lines) by choosing ‘More option’ on the top right corner and turning on the radio button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Check if ‘smooth lines’ is active. It should be turned on because it is the default value.  \n\n\n\n\n\nFigures 7-10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Change the limits of the Y-axis from 0 to 60%. This is different than in the original. See my comments later in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Compared with the original, we still will need a third time series for the share of the middle 40% of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Click on the bottom of the left green navigation bar to open ‘More Indicators’ to include custom indicators in the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Choose ‘Income Inequality’ to get the option to include a preconfigured percentile into the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures 11-14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Scroll down to select the radio box for the ‘Middle 40%’ percentile. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Confirm the default values. I will explain the different options in a later post.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Our last action adds the share of the middle 40% to our graph, as was seen in Figure 8.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Hovering with the mouse over the graphs of the interactive website, we can get tooltips with the values for every year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferences between original and replication\nIf we compare both figures side by side, we will see a significant difference. Our replication differs from the original in the years before 1900. For instance, in our figure, the people with the top 10% of income share about 60% of the total income, in contrast to the 50% share in the original graph. I need to find out where these differences come from. There may have been a correction of the computed extrapolations in an update after the book publication. In any case, this difference is not essential here. Remember, the primary purpose of the exercise is to understand the patterns of the database structure — and not (at least at the moment) to get correct figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Figure 7 of BHE, taken from the original source on Piketty’s website. The shares for the top 10% are lower. It is slightly above 50% of the total income, whereas it is about 60% in the replication. On the other hand, the share of the middle is 40% lower than that of the replication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: The result of my replication is showing higher shares for the top 10% and accordingly lower shares for the middle 40% in contrast to the original figure. However, the level of the share of the bottom 50% of the population is approximately the same in both figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other differences between the two pictures, but they are more of cosmetically nature:\n\nThe choice of colors for the various time series is different.\nThe labels of the X- and Y-axes are different. The original is labeled every 20 years and contains a vertical line every 10 years, whereas the interactive replication has a 25-year grid. The Y-axis in the replication is missing the %-sign.\nIn the original, the time-series have different symbols in the data points (circle, triangle), which is vital in black & white (book) publications.\nThe legend is in the original at a prominent place in the middle of the graph, whereas it is in the interactive replication at the bottom.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay the results\nUntil now, I have used manually taken screenshots. But there are also several possibilities to display results offered by the WID.\n\nDownload a JPG-file\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Income inequality, France, 1820-2022 download as JPG from the WID site and integrated into the Quarto text.\n\n\n\nNote that there are now fewer labels on the X- and Y-axis. The legend’s appearance has changed somewhat, and some information that is irrelevant in a static view is removed.\n\n\nCopy the URL\nAnother option is to copy the URL and integrate it as a link into the Quarto text. It opens up a web page with the figure and all the WID menus in your default browser. Others can explore the interactive graph or create their own figure from here.\nSee the example: Income inequality, France, 1820-2022\n\n\nEmbed as iframe\nAnother possibility is to embed the graph into an iframe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution 1: Embedding WID iframes has some drawbacks\n\n\n\nThe legend overlaps the lower part of the graph. You have either to plan during the construction of the graph to prevent this drawback or (better) to adapt the code in the URL itself.\nBesides, there is also an annoying cookies-consent message where the link to ‘learn more’ is wrong by pointing to another graph and not to the cookies policy.\n\n\nThe code in the above iframe is:\n&lt;iframe width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://wid.world/share/#1/countrytimeseries/sptinc_p90p100_z;sptinc_p0p50_z;sptinc_p50p90_z/FR/2015/eu/k/p/yearly/s/true/9.4765/70/curve/true/1820/2022\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\nIt turned out that besides changing the delimiter for the axis from /9.4765/70/ to /0/62/ it is also necessary to enlarge the iframe’s height to position the legend lower. With trial & error experimenting, I got a good result after changing the height from 400 to 500. Here is the adapted iframe where you can see the full figure and also the slider to change the time period of the data:"

    "text": "Getting codes for indicators\nBy far, the most important result of our replication is that the URL contains the code for used indicators, areas, and percentiles.\nhttps://wid.world/share/#1/countrytimeseries/sptinc_p90p100_z;sptinc_p0p50_z;sptinc_p50p90_z/FR/2015/eu/k/p/yearly/s/false/9.4765/70/curve/true/1820/2022\nThis is very helpful because it is now much easier to find the code explication in the Code Dictionary or the Summary Table. Let’s analyze the example of the sptinc_p90p100_z code:\n\ns: The first letter s determines the code series. s means “share” and contains a fraction between 0 and 1.\nptinc: The next five letters are the code for the series concept. This is an essential help because a massive amount of five-letter codes exist. More than half of the 38 pages of the PDF version of the code dictionary lists five-letter codes and their meaning! Searching ptinc in the online Code Dictionary with the browser search tool results in “pretax national income”.\np90p100: This one is easy. p90p100 is the top 10%, the percentiles characterizing people with an income equal to or higher than 90% of the population. Or p0p50 is the bottom 50% etc.\n\nAdditionally, we have the information from the legend that the units are adults, and the income is split equally between couples or other adult members (= 20 years or older) of the household. Therefore, we can add:\n\n992: The age code description has three numbers. 992 stands for a population of individuals over age 20.\nj: The last letter is the unit description. j means equal-split adults.\n\nWith these data, we can now look for the corresponding codes in the database and filter the database to get only the required information. The variable name is, in our case:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\ns + ptinc + 992 + j = sptinc992j\n\\end{align*}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIf we look for this complete code in the Summary Table, we can read in the column “Simple description of the variable” the following explanation:\n\nPre-tax national income is the sum of all pre-tax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors, labor and capital, before taking into account the operation of the tax/transfer system, but after taking into account the operation of pension system. The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution 2: Explaining just the procedure, not the concepts\n\n\n\nRemember that I am not discussing the concepts behind the different parameter codes. I just want to stress how to find the code for a required indicator here. Which concepts to apply and what indicator is appropriate for a specific research question will be covered in other articles."

Quote from the top second answer\n\n\nI deleted the remote origin branch X manually at the GitHub site. The local branch but also the local remote-tracking branch were still functional!\nFor every one of these three branches, one needs different commands to delete them.

After continuously struggling with the complex machinery blogdown - Hugo - Wowchemy, I feel like coming home from a trip abroad!\nFollowing the Quarto guide Creating a Blog, it took me only 2 (!) minutes to render the provided blog template locally. After just one hour, I had my blog using Quarto, GitHub, and Netlify online. And half of this time, I spent thinking about a name for my blog and what to do with my older and outdated other blogdown web presences. (To put this quick access into perspective: I already had a GitHub account, GitHub credential, and a Netlify account. And I didn’t work on the content of a blog entry but used just the installed test pages.)\nI never was happy with the fast development of Hugo that brought with it many changes and a considerable learning overhead. The same problem happened with the Academic theme by Wowchemy. The end product looked nice and ran fast, but I had already forgotten some of the many details for a good-looking blog post after two weeks. As a result, I spent more time learning the blog machinery than I had time to write about substantive subjects.\nIt was helpful when Yihui Xie introduced `blogdown::checksite()` and the possibility of freezing to a specific Hugo version. But the work in the blogdown-Hugo environment was never intuitive and satisfying. I think it’s self-explanatory that the introductory message to the blogdown book for over two three years now states as a note from the authors: “Some of the information and instructions in this book are now out of date because of changes to Hugo and the blogdown package.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface banner of blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"

Since English is not my mother tongue, it is already difficult enough to express myself precisely about complex content-related questions. I don’t need any additional technical difficulty in writing blog posts.\nIn contrast to my previous website projects, I am planning two different strategies: \n\nI will not go into the details of the website design immediately but will work on these issues from time to time.\nI will not announce the website until I am sure I will use it regularly and long-term.
